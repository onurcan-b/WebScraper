  "history": "The Chicago Park District acquired the site of Abbott Park as part of a ten-year plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served neighborhoods in post-World War II Chicago. \u00a0In 1947, the Citizens Advisory Committee on Park Sites recommended the creation of a park to serve the rapidly growing African-American community near 95th Street and Michigan Avenue. \u00a0The Park District purchased the property southeast of that intersection in 1949 and 1950, and built a swimming pool and recreational facility the following year. \u00a0In 1956, the District sold a portion of the parkland to the Board of Education for use as Harlan High School. Robert Sengstacke Abbott (1868-1940), for whom the park is named, founded the influential Chicago Defender in 1905. \u00a0Born in Georgia, Abbott received his education in southern schools, and graduated from Chicago's Kent College of Law. \u00a0He was the only African-American in the class of 1899. \u00a0Abbott's lofty goal was to eliminate racial prejudice through his newspaper. \u00a0To promote racial equality, Abbott and his Chicago Defender newspaper urged southern blacks to migrate to Chicago and other northern cities for greater economic opportunity. \u00a0By 1918, the influential newspaper had a national circulation of 125,000, making it the largest-selling black newspaper in the country. \u00a0President of his Abbott Publishing Company, Abbott was also active in civic affairs.\u00a0 He served on Governor Frank O. Lowden's Race Relations Committee in 1919, on the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago World's Fair in 1934, and on the boards of the Art Institute, the Field Museum, and the Chicago Historical Society.

  "history": "Created in 1930, Ada Park provided recreational facilities for the Morgan Park neighborhood's expanding African-American population. Initially, acquisition began in 1930.\u00a0 Acquisition to expand the park was finalized in 1955; streets and alleys were vacated in 1957 to complete the 16.65-acre park.\u00a0 The park was the last of those developed by the Calumet Park District, established in 1903. The Calumet Park District was one of 22 neighborhood park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. By 1931, Ada Park had a swimming pool and a few landscape improvements. After the Chicago Park District took control of the park in 1934, other recreational facilities were installed. The Park District erected a new bathhouse for the swimming pool in 1940, and built \"fieldhouse additions\" to the bathhouse in 1957 and 1990. Until 1934, Ada Park was known as Loomis Street Park, for the street running along its west side. Late in that year, the Calumet Park District voted to change the name to Ada Park, for the street on the park's opposite side. The street is named for Ada Sawyer Garrett (1856-1938), who sold the last remaining vacant land in the Logan Square neighborhood, the Logan Square Ball Park, to developers in 1924. Though the Chicago Park District informed the Calumet Park District that it had no authority to rename the site Ada Park, the name has been used ever since. "

  "history": "Established in 1902, Adams Park bears the name of attorney and Congressman George Adams (1840-1917) and his wife Adele (Foster) Adams. George and Adele gave the City of Chicago use of two-thirds of an acre of property in their Lincoln Park neighborhood as parkland. Placed under the jurisdiction of the City's Special Park Commission, on which George Adams served, Adams Park had playground apparatus, a shelter house, and sand court as early as 1904. In 1910, the Adamses conveyed title to the property to the City. By 1916, the Special Park Commission had added a playing field that was flooded in winter for ice skating. The City transferred Adams Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In 1997, a new interactive waterplay area, named for retired school teacher Dorothy Melamerson, opened in Adams Park. Ms. Melamerson provided funding for the children's water feature through a bequest in her will. "

  "history": "In 1881, the City of Chicago acquired a triangular property in Greater Grand Crossing from the community's original developer, Paul Cornell. A quarter-century later, renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen, a member of the City's Special Park Commission, reported that the triangle had deteriorated into \"a truck garden in a mud hole, surrounded by ditches...into which the sewage emptied.\" He further described it as \"the site of a dog pound, with other sorry-looking shacks for ornament, all bordered by a rotten plank walk on two sides.\" In 1907, Jensen began improving the site with proper drainage, substantial walks, trees, and shrubbery. In subsequent years, the Commission seeded the lawns, planted additional trees, and installed a drinking fountain. Between the early 1920s and the mid-1940s, the depressed lawn was flooded in winter for ice skating. In 1957, the City transferred Adams Park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District has maintained it as a greenspace for passive recreation ever since. The origin of the Adams Park name is unclear. Hyde Park historian Steve Treffman believes the park may have been named for John C. Adams, an official of the Cornell Watch Company, which stood across 76th Street from the park around 1900. "

  "history": "Between 1914 and 1916, the City created a municipal pier and a neighboring park by filling in submerged land east of Lake Shore Drive and north of Grand Avenue. The new municipal pier was almost immediately pressed into service as a naval training site during World War I, and in 1927, the city renamed the structure Navy Pier in honor of the trainees. The adjacent park also took the new name. Navy Pier Park, like other City parks was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In 1996, the Park District officially re-designated the park Jane Addams Memorial Park in honor of the world-renowned social reformer and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Addams founded one of North America's first settlement houses, Chicago's Hull House, which provided much-needed social services and cultural opportunities to its near west side immigrant neighborhood. Addams also worked tirelessly to promote various legal reforms, including the first juvenile-court law and an eight-hour working day for women. A six-piece sculptural grouping honoring Addams by Louise Bourgeois called \"Helping Hands\" was originally installed at Addams Memorial Park. Unfortunately, the sculptures were severely vandalized and had to be removed. \"Helping Hands\" was later restored and relocated to Chicago Women's Park and Gardens where it continues to serve as a monument to Addams' work in Chicago.

By 1931, some improvements had been made, but a plea by the North Austin Manor Neighborhood Club to move ahead with the fieldhouse could not be honored due to the District's financial condition. The Northwest Park District designated the park Roald Amundsen Park in 1933; two years after rejecting a petition to name the park for Norwegian-born football coach Knute Rockne (1888-1931). The Norwegian National League suggested the Amundsen name as a way to honor Norwegian polar adventurer Roald Amundsen (1872-1928). Amundsen led many scientific explorations in the Arctic and Antarctic, but is best known for discovering the South Pole on December 4, 1911.

William Beatty Archer (1793-1870), a Commissioner for the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which paralleled the road in the 1800s. Archer, an abolitionist as well as a civil engineer, nominated Abraham Lincoln for Vice President in 1856. The Chicago Park District acquired land from 1949-1950 and established Archer Park to provide green space in an area then experiencing significant industrial development. The new park was part of a ten-year, district-wide program to increase recreational opportunities in underserved neighborhoods in post-World War II Chicago. Archer Park provided solely outdoor recreational facilities until 1970, when the Park District constructed a small fieldhouse. "

  "history": "The South Park Commissioners acquired the land for this park in 1904.\u00a0 Development of the park included a fieldhouse, with four clubrooms, two gymnasiums, an assembly hall, and large lobby.\u00a0 Outdoor amenities such as lawns, walks, and plantings were installed and recreational facilities included an outdoor swimming pool, baseball and football fields, handball and tennis courts, and a children\u2019s playground.\u00a0 The development was completed in 1905 and there was a dedication of the park that same year.\u00a0 In 1906, the year after Armour Square opened to the public, President Theodore Roosevelt described the square and nine other related properties as \"the most notable civic achievement in any American city.\" \u00a0The South Park Commission created the ten new innovative parks to improve the difficult living conditions in Chicago's congested tenement districts. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. designed the entire system.\u00a0 The South Park Commission was one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. The first ten included five squares smaller than ten acres in size, and five parks larger than ten acres. In addition to Armour Square, these were Mark White, Russell, Davis\u00a0and Cornell Squares, and Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, Bessemer and Hamilton Parks. These properties soon influenced the development of other parks throughout the nation. An ordinance was passed on August 17, 1904 to name the park Armour Square to honor Philip D. Armour (1832-1901), Chicago's \"captain of industry.\" Owner and operator of the largest meatpacking company in the world, Armour donated a large amount of his fortune to charitable and educational institutions. These included a settlement house, the Armour Mission, and a school known as the Armour Institute of Technology, later renamed the Illinois Institute of Technology. "

  "history": "Arrigo Park, known as Vernon Park for much of its history, dates to 1859, when real estate developer Henry D. Gilpin donated the property to the City of Chicago. The City soon created a shaded \"breathing spot\" with an artificial lake and a few benches. In 1871, the modest residences surrounding Vernon Park fell to the flames of the Chicago Fire. Commercial institutions and transient rooming houses took their place. The park had deteriorated into a boggy mess as surrounding streets and structures were raised up to improve sewage removal and prevent flooding. When the City transferred control and maintenance of Vernon Park to the West Park Commission in 1885, rehabilitation began immediately. To alleviate the drainage problem, the Commission filled the artificial lake and raised the ground level of the entire site with additional fill. In 1893, the Commission undertook extensive landscape improvements and electrified the park. In 1934, with the consolidation of the 22 park districts into one, the Chicago Park District, Vernon Park came under the control and management of the new District. In 1957, the Chicago Park District acquired title to the property pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. \u00a0In 1972, the City of Chicago conveyed adjacent property to the Chicago Park District for expansion of the park. In 1974, Vernon Park was officially renamed Arrigo Park in honor of Victor Arrigo (1908-1973). A vocal advocate for the Italian-American community, Arrigo served as Illinois State Representative for Chicago's near southwest side from 1966 to 1973. Arrigo was instrumental in bringing sculptor Moses Ezekiel's statue of Christopher Columbus to the park in 1966. First exhibited in the Italian pavilion at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the bronze figure later graced a second-story alcove on State Street's Columbus Memorial Building. After the building came down in 1959, the statue went into storage. Arrigo argued that Columbus should find a new home in the City's oldest continuously Italian-American neighborhood, which was then experiencing wrenching transformation due to the construction of the University of Illinois' Circle Campus.

At the top of his tennis game, Ashe ranked No. 1 in the world and won three of four Grand Slam tournaments, the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, and the Australian Open. As captain of the Davis Cup team, he recorded 13 wins, leading the U.S. to consecutive victories in 1981 and 1982. Ashe also served as chairman of the Black Tennis and Sports Foundation, a non-profit group devoted to assisting black athletes and sports organizations.

The four-acre park also had an athletic field with grandstands, a junior baseball field, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box, and horseshoe and tennis courts. Four years after Athletic Field Park opened, due to a lack of use of the junior baseball field, and an increasing demand for tennis courts, the Commissioners replaced the ballfield area with additional tennis courts. Athletic Field Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s inventory in 1934, when the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the City's 22 independent park agencies. In the early 1960\u2019s, the Park District converted the park's locker and game room into a ceramics studio. In 1969, further improvements were made to the ceramics building, including the installation of additional kilns.\u00a0 Ceramics classes remain a popular program at Athletic Field Park. "

This park offers a lagoon, a waterfall and benches. In this green space, popular activities park patrons and their families participate in are fishing and picnics. ",
  "history": "Created as part of a speculative real estate development, Auburn Park lies within an area once known as Cummorn. William B. Ogden, Chicago\u2019s first mayor and early real estate promoter, owned much of the property in this area. A marshy area, the land originally drained seven miles southeast into the Calumet River. The first railroad line was constructed in 1852, and by the early 1870s, three other railroads ran through the community. Railroad workers began building homes in the area, and in 1872, the Auburn settlement was platted. Eggleston Mallette, purchased the area in the 1870s and Brownell real estate speculators, who subdivided, drained, and began developing the land. Within several years, a second group of real estate developers, Sanford McKnight, Henry Mather and Alfred Manning, purchased the property. Sometime between the 1870s and 1890s, one of the two groups of developers created Auburn Park, an 8-acre landscape with a meandering lagoon, a remnant of the site's original wetlands. The park helped to establish the area as an attractive and desirable community. In 1887, the Auburn Park Subdivision created this private park.\u00a0 In 1889, the Auburn community was annexed with Chicago. The following year, the City began maintaining the park, although it was still privately owned. Local residents wanted the site to become a public park. Between 1911 and 1913, the Auburn Park Improvement Association acquired and transferred the park to the City. The deed included covenants requiring that the land will forever be used as a park; the park and lagoon will always be maintained; and the name Auburn Park will never be changed. Considered the \"beauty spot of Auburn,\" the park has long provided a calm refuge from the \"weary\" City. Auburn Park was transferred from the City to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The Chicago Department of Transportation restored the parks historic bridges in the late 1990s. "

Augusta Boulevard apparently takes its name from Augusta Carpenter, daughter of Philo Carpenter (1805-1886), Chicago's first druggist. Carpenter traveled from Chicago to Troy, New York by mail coach and Indian canoe in 1832. Upon arrival, he opened a drug store near the river on what is now Lake Street. By 1834, he had made a fortune investing in real estate. Carpenter later became a vocal advocate of abolitionism and temperance, and served as a director of the Chicago Theological Seminary. The Chicago Park District has recognized Carpenter's role in the City's early history by naming another park for him. "

  "history": "In 1865, Henry W. Austin (1828-1889) purchased 280 acres of poorly drained prairie land in Cicero Township. Within the next few years, Austin subdivided the area, laid out streets, and planted trees, calling the new development Austinville. Twenty years later, in December 1885, Henry Austin and his wife Martha donated three large lots to the Town of Cicero for use as a public park. Austin Park became Chicago's responsibility in 1899, after the area was annexed to the City. In 1906, noted landscape architect and Special Park Commission member Jens Jensen drew up a plan for the long, narrow site along the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad embankment. The park's most notable landscape feature was a meandering lagoon, with boys' and girls' wading pools and a wooden bridge at one end, and small wooded islands at the other. In 1908, the Special Park Commission added a dressing room facility with a 10-foot pergola and electric lights for night swimming. The lagoon was heavily used from the first. In 1910, the Special Park Commission invited underprivileged children from the City's settlement houses to use the wading pools, providing them with free bathing suits. Fifty-five thousand children used the wading pools during the summer of 1915. By 1930, attendance had increased to nearly 90,000. In the wintertime, children also ice skated on the frozen lagoons. The City transferred Austin Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. By this time, the lagoon had deteriorated, and the Park District soon filled in the eastern section. At the lagoon's west end, the Park District transformed the boys' and girls' wading pools into a wading pool and spray pool, and constructed a new changing facility. In 1992, the Park District installed the first soft surface playground where the eastern portion of the lagoon once lay. "

In early 1991, the Board of Education formally transferred the site to the Chicago Park District, which promptly constructed a new soft surface playground. Installation of new trees and plantings followed in subsequent years. For nearly three decades, the site was known only as Park No. 285. In 1993, the Park District officially designated the property Austin-Foster Park, a name commonly used by area residents. The name makes reference to the two adjacent streets, Austin Avenue and Foster Avenue. Austin Boulevard recognizes Henry W. Austin (1828-1889), who purchased prairie land west of Chicago in 1865 and laid out the town of Austinville (later the City's Austin community) not long thereafter. Foster Avenue honors John H. Foster (1796-1874), a physician and landowner who arrived in Chicago around 1835. Foster served on both the Chicago and Illinois Boards of Education. "

  "history": "In 1865, businessman and real estate speculator Henry W. Austin created a lovely 280-acre subdivision in Cicero Township. Austin's development included wide, tree-lined streets and a small park, originally known as Holden Park. The township selected Austin as its seat of government, and in 1870 constructed a brick town hall building, with a cupola and eclectic details, in the center of Holden Park. In 1898, residents of Austin, having a majority on Cicero's town council, used political influence to allow the extension of the Lake Street elevated line into their community. This infuriated residents of other areas within Cicero Township, such as Oak Park and Berwyn, who retaliated the following year by holding a joint election to force Austin's annexation to the City of Chicago. Much to the dismay of local residents, this effort succeeded and Austin became part of Chicago in 1899. The City took over the Cicero Town Hall and began using it as a library and police station as well as for other public functions. The City passed an ordinance that granted control of Holden Park to the West Park Commission in 1927. This was subject to a 99-year lease the City granted to the Chicago Public Library and also required the West Park Commissioner to build a community building in Holden Park. Because the old town hall had housed a branch library for several years, the West Park Commissioners agreed to the construction of a new public library in the park, designed by architect Alfred S. Alschuler. This public library is still operating today. At the same time, the West Park Commission also built a fieldhouse for the newly renamed Austin Town Hall Park. The large brick Georgian Revival-style building was influenced by Philadelphia's Independence Hall.\u00a0 The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable park buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Humboldt and Douglas Park Fieldhouses.\u00a0 The construction of the Austin Town Hall fieldhouse was completed in 1929. In 1934, with the Park Consolidation Act, the 22 park districts were merged into one, the Chicago Park District, and Austin Town Hall Park came under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Park District.\u00a0 The City transferred Austin Town Hall Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.

  "history": "In 1889, when Chicago annexed the Village of Hyde Park, it included an area with a city dump, swamps, and \"Mud Lake,\" a popular spot for fishing and hunting. The mosquito-infested swampland remained largely unsettled until after the installation of a sewage system in 1900. At first called Pierce's Park, the area became known as Pennytown for a general store owner named Penny who sold homemade popcorn balls. In 1910, Avalon Park Community Church members successfully led an effort to rename the community Avalon Park. The church, community, and a local street pay homage to the English Isle of Avalon, believed to be the burial place of legendary King Arthur. In 1923, Avalon Park civic groups began asking for the creation of a park in their neighborhood. Due to funding limitations, the South Park Commission was slow to respond. The commissioners agreed to begin identifying potential sites in 1927. Finally, in 1930 the South Park Commission acquired the land for Avalon Park. The following year, in-house landscape architect Robert Moore created a plan for Avalon Park that was inspired by the earlier South Park designs of the nationally renowned Olmsted Brothers firm. Due to the Great Depression, however, the South Park Commission was unable to move forward with improvements. In 1934, the city's 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District, and federal relief funding soon allowed work to begin on Avalon Park. Only partially realizing Moore's plan, the Park District installed playfields, a running track, tennis and horseshoe courts, and a combination shelter and comfort station. After needing a more substantial fieldhouse for years, the Park District constructed an attractive modern brick building in 1958. "

  "history": "Created by the Irving Park District, Avondale Park takes its name from the surrounding Avondale neighborhood. An early racially integrated suburb, Avondale became part of Chicago when the City annexed the Town of Jefferson in 1889. European immigrants began settling there and residential construction boomed in the 1920s. \u00a0The Irving Park District board responded by making plans for the park. Land acquisition was initiated in 1925 and completed in 1930, improvements began immediately. By the end of 1930, the Park District had constructed an attractive brick fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld. Lawn, shrubbery, trees, and flowers soon graced Avondale Park's landscape. By the early 1930s, the park included a playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box, and tennis courts. Avondale Park became part of the Chicago Park District in 1934, when the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the City's 22 independent park agencies. Twenty-five years later, the park's size was reduced to just over one acre when its entire northeast portion was taken to make way for the Kennedy Expressway. Eliminating Avondale Park's playfield and tennis courts, the Park District redesigned the site to incorporate volleyball and basketball courts and a swimming pool. In the early 1990s, the Park District installed a new soft surface playground in Avondale Park, and replanted its landscape. "

  "history": "Previously known as Throop Park, Back of the Yards Park is one of many small City parks created to meet the growing recreational demands of post-World War II Chicago. The City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation developed this Lower West Side park in the late 1940s, improving it with a gravel-surfaced playground and a spray pool. Within a few years, a basketball court was added. The City transferred Back of the Yards Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In 1976, the Park District thoroughly rehabilitated the site, building a shelter, enhancing the plantings, and constructing bleachers around the resurfaced basketball court. Subsequent improvements included a soft surface playground and ornamental fencing. In 1998, the Park District enlarged the park by expanding into an adjacent vacant lot. In 1999, the Park District renamed this site Back of the Yards Park to avoid confusion with a second Throop Park to the north. Back of the Yards was the name historically used for what is now known as the New City Community Area. The area was so named because it lay east, south, and west of the enormous Union Stock Yards, which provided jobs for the neighborhood's many immigrant residents. Opened in 1865 and paid for by nine Chicago railroads, the Union Stock Yards and Transit Company consolidated the city's four major stockyards in one location. In 1871 alone, the Yards received over 500,000 cattle and nearly 2,400,000 hogs. "

The Transit Authority sold the property to the Park District in 1973. In 1990, the park was rehabilitated with a soft surface playground featuring a redwood play structure. The Park District designated the site, Lilac Park in 1975, as part of a citywide program to name parks for trees and flowers. Within three years, however, the park was renamed in honor of Frederick Baraga (1797-1868), a Slovenian immigrant and the first Catholic Bishop of Marquette, Michigan. Furthering his missionary efforts, Baraga worked to educate the Native Americans of the Upper Midwest during the mid-19th century. He authored the first dictionary and grammar books in the Ojibwa language. "

An ornamental bush often used for hedges, the barberry has impressive vibrant fall foliage and long-lasting red berries that provide color throughout the winter. Historically, Arabs used the berries for sherbet, and probably knew the plant as berberys, meaning \"shell,\" for its hollowed leaves. Barberries are also associated with the Berbers, who cultivated them on Africa's Barbary Coast. In 2012, the City transferred City-owned parcels that were located adjacent to the park to the District for the expansion of the park. "

  "history": "On October 12, 1900, the Chicago Tribune reported that Erastus A. Barnard, an early settler of the Beverly community area, had donated approximately two acres of land to the city for a small park. At the time, this lovely area of rolling hills and large, stately homes had a small population. It was expected, however, that the area's recent annexation to Chicago would spur significant growth. The City of Chicago acquired the land from Barnard and his wife in 1902.\u00a0 The City agreed to make landscape improvements, install children's playground equipment, and name the park in honor of Mr. Barnard's deceased daughter, Amy L. Barnard. The nearby Alice Barnard School had previously been named for Amy Barnard's aunt, a teacher and local historian. By 1909, Barnard Park included playground equipment, tennis courts, a drinking fountain, a large wading pool, and a tool shed. For many years, the park's landscape was flooded for ice-skating in the winter. During the 1930s and 1940s, between 2,000 and 5,000 skaters used the park each winter. The City transferred Barnard Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. By 1966, the Park District had replaced the original wading pool with a smaller spray pool, demolished the tool shed, installed new playground equipment, and planted additional trees. "

  "history": "Barrett Park dates to just after 1900, when the surrounding Lower West Side neighborhood was home to thousands of newly arrived southern- and eastern-European immigrants. The park began as a playground leased and operated by the Gad's Hill Center, a local social welfare settlement house. The City of Chicago's Special Park Commission took over the lease in December 1907, furthering its goal of operating playgrounds and small parks in the city's most densely populated neighborhoods. That spring, the commission installed playground equipment and constructed an attractive frame building with a kindergarten room and toilets. In 1910, the park was named for reformer and physician Dr. Walter Christopher (1859-1905), in recognition of his lifelong service to children. By the following year, the park's frame structure had been equipped with gymnastics apparatus and was being used as a fieldhouse. Staff provided physical training for children, as well as for young men and women. Annual attendance at Christopher Playground reached an impressive 200,000 patrons in 1914. The City of Chicago the park property in 1926. By this time, the Special Park Commission no longer existed, and the Bureau of Parks and Recreation had taken over. In 1928, the City renamed the park in honor of Charles V. Barrett (1882 - 1932). Born and raised near this West Side Park, Barrett worked as a teamster through high school and went on to attend law school at the University of Illinois. He became a prominent leader in the Republican Party and served on the Cook County Board of Review. Barrett was active in social and civic affairs, and was known as a strong supporter of athletics for West Side youth. The Bureau of Parks and Recreation replaced the makeshift fieldhouse with a new brick recreation building in late 1952. The City of Chicago transferred Barrett Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. Ten years later, the Park District installed new playground equipment, which was updated in the 1980s and again in 1990. A new junior soccer field and a basketball court were added in 1993. "

At the fountain plaza, park patrons are greeted with five stainless steel gates at the northwest entry acting as a gateway to the park.

During the War of 1812, some Native Americans in this area were allied with the British. After the British captured the American garrison at Mackinac, General William Hull ordered the evacuation of Fort Dearborn, which was located at the juncture between Lake Michigan and the Chicago River. As approximately 500 Potawatomi gathered at the fort, its commander, Captain Nathan Heald prepared to abandon his post. On August 15, 1812, a procession soldiers and settlers including women and children left the fort, and began an attempt to walk to Fort Wayne. After walking a mile-and-a-half south of the fort, the Native Americans attacked the group. More than 50 soldiers and settlers were brutally killed and the others were taken as prisoners to sell to the British. (Friendly Potawatomi, such as Black Partridge saved some). A number of the victims died after they were taken prisoner and others were released. The Native Americans burned Fort Dearborn down, and it remained unoccupied until it was rebuilt by the US military in 1816. Over the next couple of decades, the US government began forcibly removing Native Americans from the region and relocating them to areas west of the Mississippi River. Also known as, the Fort Dearborn Massacre, the Battle of Fort Dearborn has been depicted in some early works of public art including a bas-relief sculpture on the Michigan Avenue Bridge. "

  "history": "In the early 1900s, Chicago's Park Commissions began building natatoriums, facilities with showers, indoor swimming pools, and gyms, to provide public bathing and recreational opportunities to the City's increasingly crowded neighborhoods. By 1915, Mayor Carter H. Harrison II and the Special Park Commission had hit upon the idea of building natatoriums adjacent to city pumping stations to take advantage of excess steam generated there. The Springfield Avenue natatorium, adjacent to the pumping station in the rapidly growing Humboldt Park neighborhood, was one of three such facilities under construction in that year. The others were the Roseland (later Griffith, in Block Park) natatorium and the Jackson natatorium on Central Park Avenue. On March 29, 1915, at the suggestion of Mayor Harrison, the Special Park Commission named the new Humboldt Park facility located on Springfield Avenue in honor of late ten-term Republican Alderman A.W. Beilfuss (1854-1914). A native of Germany and a printer by trade, Beilfuss was serving as Special Park Commission Chairman at the time of his death. Beilfuss Natatorium was so popular that by 1935, it drew more than 300,000 patrons. During World War II, boys at Beilfuss published a local-interest newspaper that was circulated to former patrons serving in the military around the world. During the same period, the City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation installed a playground adjacent to the natatorium, as well as an athletic field that was flooded for skating in winter. Pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957, the Chicago Park District began to lease the Beilfuss Natatorium and the adjacent parkland from the City. The Park District replaced the original play equipment with a new soft surface playground in 1992. In 1998, the outmoded 1915 natatorium was razed. "

  "history": "In the late 1990s, the Chicago Park District participated in a unique partnership with the City of Chicago, Cook County, suburban communities, State of Illinois, and CorLands (the real estate affiliate of the Open Lands Project of Chicago) to create linear park in Chicago\u2019s East Side Community Area. The goal was to transform an abandoned stretch of Penn Central Railroad Company right-of-way into a greenway with a bicycle path. Decades earlier, John \u201cBeans\u201d Beniac (1926- 1994), who lived across from the railway property, had become frustrated by the site\u2019s unkempt appearance. After Beniac recovered from open-heart surgery in the 1970s, he needed to keep busy, so he began cleaning up the site. He mowed the knee-high grass, pulled weeks, and removed wheelbarrows filled with old tires, junk, and debris. Later, he added benches, trees, and a bocce court. Neighbors began joining him with the work, and they soon held cookouts and other community gatherings there. In 1997, the Chicago Park District officially acquired the 7-acre property, including the stretch tended by Beniac.\u00a0 This became a one-mile portion of a new 10-mile trail system that stretches from Calumet Park to forest preserves and parks in the south suburbs. The long-term goal is to have this 10-mile area to serve as a link in the 475-mile Grand Illinois Trail. In 2010, the City of Chicago acquired parcel of land adjacent to the park and that same year transferred to the Chicago Park District for the expansion of the park. Although the site was nicknamed the \u201cBurnham Greenway\u201d because Chicago\u2019s famous planner Daniel H.

Berger, who lived with his family in one of the large homes that lined the Sheridan Road before 1950, was a tax consultant and real estate developer, and a member of numerous philanthropic and civic groups.

By 1937, the City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation was operating 27 street-end beaches, including one at the end of Edgewater's Granville Avenue, near Berger's home. Pursuant to the City and Park District Exchange of Functions Act, the City transferred Granville Beach and Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957. By this time, many of Edgewater's fashionable Sheridan Road homes had given way to modern high-rises. In an attempt to address the recreational needs of the many apartment dwellers, the City in 1976 constructed a playground along the northern right-of-way of Granville Avenue, leasing it to the Park District. Residents of the crowded Edgewater community still needed more parkland.\u00a0 In 1974, the Park District purchased land from the Clerics of St. Viator and in 1981 purchased additional land from the Clerics of St. Viator to expand the park. The property included two of the few remaining Sheridan Road mansions, the south one designed by William Carbys Zimmerman and the north one by Myron H. Church. In 1988, the Park District rehabilitated the homes, which are used as a recreational building and a cultural center, respectively. Berger Park offers many activities, including senior aerobics; computer, jewelry making, and writing classes; and theater and music programs for children and adults. "

  "history": "The South Park Commission acquired land in 1904 for the creation of Bessemer Park.\u00a0 This park was part of what proved to be a nationally influential neighborhood park system. At the time, vast numbers of immigrants were arriving in Chicago with hopes of achieving the \"American dream.\" Instead, many found intolerable living and working conditions. The City\u2019s existing parks were too far away to offer any relief. Superintendent J. Frank Foster conceived a new type of park for these areas. The innovative parks not only provided beautifully landscaped \"breathing spaces,\" but also public bathing, the City\u2019s first branch libraries, classes and vocational training, inexpensive hot meals, health care, and a variety of recreational programs. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. designed the whole system of new parks. In addition to Bessemer Park, the neighborhood park system included Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, and Hamilton Parks, and Mark White, Russell, Davis, Armour, Cornell Squares.\u00a0 Bessemer Park development included a fieldhouse that housed an assembly hall, lockers and showers for both men and women which were located on opposite sides of the building, and six clubrooms. The outdoor amenities were walks, lawns, an outdoor swimming pool, a wading pool, tennis courts, and athletic fields. The official opening of the park to the public took place with a dedication on September, 10, 1905. The 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934 to create the Chicago Park District and Bessemer Park became part of the Park District\u2019s portfolio.\u00a0 Streets were vacated in 1957 to complete the 20.27-acre park. In 1907, Bessemer Park was named for Sir Henry Bessemer (1813-1898), an Englishman who perfected the process of making steel, which revolutionized the steel industry worldwide. The name is especially appropriate because the park is located a mile away from South Chicago's once-thriving steel mills. "

  "history": "Beverly Park lies in the western portion of the lovely Chicago community area from which it takes its name. The community's rugged, wooded hills are said to have reminded an early settler of the terrain around Beverly, Massachusetts. Perched above the rest of Chicago on a glacial ridge, Beverly was only sparsely settled until 1872, when the Rock Island Railroad established commuter service into the city. The railroad called its 91st Street station Beverly Hills, well before its better-known California counterpart got its name. Much open space remained in the westernmost part of Beverly until after World War II, when residential building surged. To meet the area's increasing recreational needs, the Chicago Park District acquired land for this new park in 1949 and completed the land acquisition in 1953. Park District landscape architect Bart Austin designed a plan for the 13.2-acre park in 1952. Austin placed intensive-use recreational activities such as playgrounds and tennis courts on either side of a of a long, open meadow designed for ball games and passive recreation. The Park District erected a small fieldhouse for indoor activities. The long vista down the meadow frames a view of a church south of the park. In 1979, the Park District dedicated one of the Beverly Park baseball diamonds in honor of John Wieczorek. When Wieczorek died at the early age of 23, he had already distinguished himself through his dedication to local youth. His efforts helped to ensure the success of the Beverly Park baseball program.

  "history": "In 1856, early lumber mill owner and real estate speculator George Bickerdike (1806-1880) transferred a small rectangular property to the City of Chicago as parkland. Fifteen years before Chicago's Great Fire, Bickerdike and other developers were already conscious of the potential for fire to spread quickly through the City. Bickerdike Square provided some fire protection within the developer's 84-acre subdivision, a rapidly growing area in what was then the City's northwest side. In 1899, the City formed the Special Park Commission to study Chicago's open space needs and to create playgrounds. Within a few years, the Commission also began managing all of the City's existing parks. In 1906, renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen, serving as a member of the Special Park Commission, developed improvement plans for a number of City parks. The area around Bickerdike Square had become run down, and the park was considered a \"loafer's garden.\" Jensen's plan for Bickerdike Square called for a circular fountain as the centerpiece, flanked by two rectangular lily pools. Jensen placed shrubs and trees around the edges, and enclosed Bickerdike Square with an ornamental fence and flower vases. Work was completed within the next few years. Bickerdike Square remained a City park until 1957, when it was transferred to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In the following decades, the park's lily pools were removed and the fountain was converted to a planter. "

Early improvements to Blackhawk Park included a wading pool, a playground, tennis courts, and electric lighting.\u00a0 Land acquisition for the park was completed in 1922.\u00a0 Also, in 1922, the Northwest Park District named the park to honor the 86th Division, a World War I Army unit known as the Blackhawk Division of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Composed of volunteers and draftees from Illinois, the Division took its name from the Sac Chief Black Hawk (1767-1838). In 1832, Black Hawk led a group of Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo Indians west across the Mississippi into Illinois in a futile attempt to reclaim their ancestral lands, from which they had been forced in the 1820s. Though his forces were beaten back and fell to final defeat on August 2, 1832, Chief Black Hawk has long been revered for his bravery and perseverance. In 1926, a small brick field house with a gambrel roof was built in the park. Architect Albert\u00a0Schwartz designed the building. Altogether, he produced six field houses for the\u00a0Northwest and Old Portage Park Districts. Two years after the completion of the original field house, architect Walter W.

In 1979, the park was named for Gertrude Blackwelder, a former resident of the Village of Morgan Park. In 1844, Englishman Thomas Leeds Morgan began buying thousands of acres of land south of Chicago. After the Civil War, Morgan's homestead became the site of Morgan Park, a new residential suburb incorporated in 1882. Among Morgan Park's early residents were Isaac S. and Gertrude B. Blackwelder, whose home at 10910 Prospect Avenue quickly became a social center for the community. Isaac Blackwelder was the president of the Village of Morgan Park prior to its annexation to Chicago. Gertrude Blackwelder was a founder of the Morgan Park Women's Club, and a member of the community's school board. She is also said to have been \"the first woman to cast a ballot in the State of Illinois.\" Morgan Park's annexation to Chicago brought improvements and services, spurring residential development after 1900.

  "history": "When the City of Chicago purchased property for a pumping station in the Roseland Community Area in 1912, it donated the excess land to the Special Park Commission for the creation of a park and natatorium. Mayor Carter H. Harrison established the Special Park Commission in 1899 at the urging of members of the Municipal Science Club. The year before, reformer Jacob Riis, speaking before the club, had made an impassioned plea for playground development in crowded immigrant neighborhoods. Harrison created the commission to study the City\u2019s needs for small parks and playgrounds. The commission soon began working with civic groups to promote park creation, and even accepted donations of land for playground development. By 1915, the commission had jurisdiction over more than 100 properties, with 46 additional playgrounds under construction. At three of these properties, including the Roseland site, the commission was building natatoriums with swimming and changing room facilities. All three adjoined pumping stations to take advantage of surplus steam generated there. Mayor Carter H. Harrison II suggested that the Roseland natatorium be named for 25th Ward Alderman Robert Griffith (1848-1900), an active promoter of the Special Park Commission and its first chairman. The new natatorium opened to the public the following year, equipped to serve 1,500 swimming patrons per day. A gymnasium was added sometime during the following decade. By 1930, the Department of Parks and Recreation, successor to the Special Park Commission, considered the lawns surrounding the natatorium as a separate site, Roseland Park.\u00a0 Around 1940, the city renamed the small park for Eugene H. Block (1865-1938), alderman for the 33rd and 9th wards between 1910 and 1917. Block also served as chairman of the Special Park Commission and later became the first chairman of the City Council Committee on Parks, Playgrounds, and Recreation. In 1957, the Chicago Park District began leasing Block Park and Griffith Natatorium from the City of Chicago Water Fund.\u00a0 The two properties were later consolidated into a single site known as Block Park. The outmoded 1915 natatorium building was demolished in 1998, and its site converted to greenspace.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District continues to lease this park from the City of Chicago\u2019s Department of Water Management.

  "history": "Founded in 1886, Chicago's Sears, Roebuck & Company capitalized on the City's status as the nation's railroad hub and achieved great success in the mail order shipping business. By 1906, Sears had become the world's largest mail order shipping company and needed a new plant to efficiently fill its customers' orders. Sears hired the architecture firm of Nimmons & Fellows to design a massive new four-building complex, complete with tower, on South Homan Avenue in the North Lawndale community. After moving its operations to suburban Hoffman Estates in the early 1990s, Sears was ready to abandon the Homan Avenue facility, providing a unique opportunity for positive change in struggling North Lawndale. Working closely with the City and The Shaw Company, a real estate developer, Sears made plans to redevelop the property as Homan Square. Some of the original structures would be rehabilitated, while others would be replaced with new homes. Sears agreed to donate nearly two acres to the Chicago Park District for development as parkland. The Chicago Park District acquired the property in 1995 from the West Side Affordable Housing Limited Partnership.\u00a0 The Park District prepared an inventive park design featuring an enormous interactive sundial on a central plaza. Shade trees, picnic gardens, and playground equipment surrounded the plaza. Commonly known as Sears Park and Homan Square Park, in 1997, the Park District officially named the site in honor of Leo Roscoe Boler, Sr. (1922-1994). Boler arrived in Chicago from Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 1946. After graduating from the Blackstone School of Law, he became an educator, and with his wife, Joyce Adamson Boler, founded the Boler and Boler Agency, a real estate and insurance brokerage firm. A resident of North Lawndale for nearly 50 years, Boler was active in many west side political and civic groups. "

  "history": "In 1899, Mayor Carter Harrison formed the Special Park Commission to study Chicago's open space needs and establish playgrounds in densely populated neighborhoods. Two years later, the commission created Bosley Park. Originally known as Holden Playground, the new park provided breathing space in the overcrowded Bridgeport neighborhood as well as a playground for nearby Holden Elementary School. Recognizing that, at less than one acre, this small playground could not meet all of the community's recreational needs, the Special Park Commission began efforts to enlarge the park. In 1902, the City began leasing adjacent property from the University of Chicago and a private owner, with the option to buy the land in the future. Then in 1907, the City extended the lease agreement with the University of Chicago to include additional property, expanding the park to more than two acres in size. After its expansion, Holden Park included a small recreation building, sand boxes, playground equipment, and a playfield. During wintertime, the playfield was flooded for ice skating and a toboggan slide was erected.\u00a0 In 1916, Mr. William F. Bosley donated $9,000, allowing the City to purchase the leased property. In gratitude for this generous donation, the City renamed the site for Bosley.\u00a0 After initial improvements, the park remained largely unchanged until 1939, when the city installed a wading pool at one end of the rectangular site. In the early 1950s, the wading pool was converted to a spray pool and basketball courts were installed. In 1957, the City transferred Bosley Park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 The City of Chicago acquired additional land adjacent to Bosley Park; this property was transferred to the Park District in 1991 to expand the park.\u00a0 Thirty years later, the park received a new soft surface playground and its landscape underwent a major re-planting.

  "history": "Arnita Young Boswell Park lies in the south side Woodlawn neighborhood, a once-thriving community that sprang to life with the construction of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park. \u00a0By 1940, the Woodlawn neighborhood had begun to deteriorate.\u00a0 The downward slide continued through the late 1960s, when the neighborhood became a Mid-South Model Cities Target Area for urban renewal efforts. About the same time, the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Woodlawn Urban Progress Center improved two adjacent vacant lots on University Avenue with a gravel-surfaced playground. The Chicago Park District identified the site for park development in 1968. \u00a0In 1969, the Chicago Park District acquired the property with funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u00a0 A few years later, the Park District named the park Chokeberry Park.\u00a0 The Park District soon replaced the gravel-surfaced playground with two basketball courts, a volleyball court, playground equipment, and a shelter house. A soft surface playground was added in 1990. Known previously as Chokeberry Park, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners renamed the site in 2004 as part of an initiative to recognize the achievements of significant Chicago women. Arnita Young Boswell (1920 \u2013 2002) was an accomplished social worker, educator, and activist. Born in Detroit and raised in Kentucky, Arnita was the daughter of Whitney M. Young, Sr., president of the Lincoln Institute and Laura Ray Young, one of the nation\u2019s first African-American postmasters. Arnita worked as a professor of social work at the University of Chicago from 1961 to 1980, and later became director of social services for special needs children at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She also served as the director of Family Resources Center at the Robert Taylor Homes and was the first national director for project Head Start and for the social workers of the Chicago Public Schools. Along with her renowned brother, Whitney Young, Jr., Arnita Young Boswell played an important role in America\u2019s Civil Rights Movement. When Rev. Martin Luther King led a major civil rights march in Chicago in 1966, Young Boswell directed the women\u2019s division of the demonstration. She founded Chicago\u2019s League of Black Women and the National Hook-up of Black Women. She also served on the Women\u2019s Board of the Chicago Urban League. Dr. Arnita Young Boswell worked from an office at 5217 S. University, approximately two miles from the park. "

In 1957, the City transferred the park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange Functions Act. The Park District rebuilt the playground and installed new tennis courts in 1975. For years, the site was known as Bensley Park for a nearby street. In 1989, at the request of the United Neighborhood Organization of Southeast Chicago, the Park District renamed the site Bradley Park in honor of local resident and community activist Josephine Bradley.

  "history": "During the decade between 1920 and 1930, the population of the fashionable Beverly Community Area grew by nearly 80%. To meet the area's increasing recreational needs, the Ridge Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, began to develop a new park in Beverly's Brainerd neighborhood. In 1932, the Ridge Park District attempted to purchase some Chicago Board of Education property in the neighborhood; however, financial difficulties delayed the transaction. By the time the Chicago Park District was created in 1934, the Ridge Park District had made only an initial down payment on the property. Three years later, in 1937, a delegation from the Brainerd Improvement Association approached the Chicago Park District commissioners, urging them to acquire and develop the park. \u00a0The Chicago Park District finalized the land purchase the following year and acquired the property from the Chicago Board of Education. The Chicago Park District quickly began improvements, installing outdoor athletic facilities and constructing a small fieldhouse. In the 1970s, a larger fieldhouse took the place of the original. The park was named Brainerd Park in 1941. The Brainerd Park name derives from that of Mr. Brainerd, one of five founders of the Rock Island Railroad for whom Beverly area streets were named. Though Brainerd Street became 91st Street when the City of Chicago annexed the northern portion of Beverly in 1890, the neighborhood designation survived, and was passed on to this park. "

  "history": "Brands Park bears the name of the German-American family that owned the site for many years. Formally established as a park in the 1920s, the property was used as a picnic grove for years before. The Brands grove had local notoriety as the site of many Clan-na-gael, Schwabenverein, and old settlers' picnics. Shortly after the 1917 with the formation of the River Park District, (one of 22 independent park commissions later consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934), residents of the Avondale neighborhood petitioned the new park board to purchase the Brands Picnic Grove site.\u00a0 In 1925, the River Park District initiated acquisition of the property, but negotiations with the property owner proved difficult, and land acquisition was not completed until 1927. Improvements began in 1928, following plans developed by the Chicago Landscape Company.\u00a0 The new facilities included a playground; basketball, horseshoe, and tennis courts; and an athletic field that was flooded for ice-skating in winter. These recreational features were set in an attractive landscape of lawn and trees. The River Park District adapted an existing building on the site for fieldhouse purposes. Shortly after the Chicago Park District took over Brands Park in 1934; Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld enlarged and remodeled the fieldhouse to include club, game, and shower rooms; a workshop; and a community hall. In the mid-1970s, the park district demolished the old brick structure, which had deteriorated significantly. In its place, the district built a new, larger fieldhouse, redesigning the surrounding landscape. More recent improvements included rehabilitating the playground, tennis courts, and plantings. "

  "history": "Subdivided by John Lewis Cochran in the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago's far north Edgewater neighborhood grew rapidly after 1900, as single-family homes filled the area west of Broadway and handsome apartment buildings sprang up just west of Lake Michigan. In 1916, architects Carpenter & Weldon designed the enormous Winter Garden Ice Skating Rink as a recreational amenity for the thriving community. It is unclear whether the ice rink, located at Broadway and Thorndale Avenue, ever opened for business. By the end of World War I, however, the State of Illinois had modified the new structure for use as an armory. For years, the Illinois National Guard used the building for drilling and training. The Broadway Armory simultaneously offered various recreational opportunities to the community, including ice skating, roller-skating, and tennis. After World War II, Edgewater became increasingly crowded, as large homes and apartments were carved into smaller units, and a long string of high-rises rose up along the lakeshore. There were few recreational facilities in the densely populated neighborhood. In the mid-1970s, the Edgewater Community Council began advocating the development of an indoor recreation center at the Broadway Armory. In 1979, the Chicago Park District signed a 25-year lease with the State for the use of a portion of the structure. After obtaining more than $2 million in state and federal funding for capital improvements, the Park District opened the new Broadway Armory indoor recreation center in 1985. The facility soon offered many popular programs, including pre-school and pre-kindergarten classes, performing arts, photography, and aerobics. Late-night basketball leagues began making use of the enormous drill hall, large enough to hold five gymnasia. The Park District purchased the armory in 1998 from the State of Illinois Department of Military Affairs, after the State decided the facility was no longer needed for military purposes.\u00a0 The park was officially named Broadway Armory Park in 2013.

  "history": "The affluent Edgewater neighborhood began to experience decline in the years following World War II. Landlords subdivided large homes and apartments into many smaller units. Edgewater's population increased by 10,000 between 1960 and 1970. In 1971, the Chicago Park District worked with the Lakewood Balmoral Residence Council to establish a playlot on North Broadway to meet the growing community's recreational needs. The Park District acquired the property in 1974 with the help of a grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Improvements began three years later, with the demolition of a small building that stood on the site. In 1978, the Park District named the new park for life-long Edgewater resident Charles H.

Anderson (formerly Max Aronson), had his start in the 1903 Western The Great Train Robbery. In 1907, Anderson, together with Chicagoan George Spoor, formed Essanay Studios. The following year, Anderson made The Life of Jesse James. In search of more realistic backdrops, Anderson took his film crews west to shoot further cowboy adventures, establishing the Essanay Western Company at Niles Canyon, California. Anderson created the much-loved Broncho Billy character in 1911, and went on to star in 376 Broncho Billy films. Essanay Studios closed its doors in 1917. "

During the preceding decade, the population of the Edison Park neighborhood had increased from 950 to over 5,000 people, but the area's fine homes were still interspersed with farmland. In 1931, the Edison Park District purchased a 2.7-acre tract of open land in the eastern portion of its territory. Also, in 1931 the park site was named Brooks Park in honor of Edison Park District President Oscar E. Brooks (1869--), a prominent local resident and general contractor, who had served as village trustee for five years before becoming a park board member in 1920. By the fall of 1932, improvements were under way at Brooks Park.

Real estate speculator James B. Waller established the area as a suburb in 1860, building his own stately home and naming it Buena, possibly in honor of a borough in his native New Jersey. The city annexed the Buena Park neighborhood in 1889, and by the turn of the century, it was a fashionable district of tree-lined streets and fine homes and apartment buildings. When the citizens association gave the park to the City, they stipulated that it would always be known as Buena Circle Park, would forever be used as a public park, and would always remain free of any buildings whatsoever. In 1957, the City transferred Buena Circle Park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. Playground equipment was added in the early 1960s, and a few years later, the Park District briefly considered constructing a swimming pool in the park. In 1991, the park received major improvements including a new accessible playlot, lighting, and plantings as part of an initiative to transform nearby vacant land into the new Challenger Park. "

  "description": "Buffalo Park is one of many park properties used only for passive recreation. This small tranquil park is 0.23 acres and is set in the beautiful Ravenswood Manor community at California/Sunnyside/Manor. Visit nearby Horner Park for programming options. ",
  "history": "By an overwhelming majority, residents of the Ravenswood Manor and Ravenswood Gardens neighborhoods voted to create their own independent park district in 1914. Although these were comfortable, middle-class neighborhoods, the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Park District had limited financial resources because it could collect no more than 3% of the assessed property valuation within its 1/4-mile territory. The new park district could only afford to create very small parks, which emphasized landscape improvements, rather than recreational facilities. In 1915, the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Park District acquired the land and began creating a .07-acre park on a triangular property between Sunnyside and California Avenues and Manor Drive. The following year, Charles J. Nilson, a local contractor and cement finisher was hired to create a fountain in the tiny new park. Because Nilson's circular fountain included three ornamental buffalo heads, the site soon became known as Buffalo Park. Buffalo Park became part of the Chicago Park District in 1934, when the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the City's 22 independent park agencies. In the late 1930s, Park District improvements included a fanciful perennial garden, which surrounded the fountain. Unfortunately, the fountain soon suffered from severe deterioration and by the early 1950s, both the fountain and garden had been removed. "

  "description": "Burnham Park totals 654 acres and sits on Chicago\u2019s Lakefront just south of Grant Park. The park was named for Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham, who envisioned a south lakefront park with a series of manmade islands, linear boating harbor, beaches, meadows, and playfields, as published in his seminal The\u00a0Plan of Chicago of 1909. Today, Burnham Park features the naturalistic Promontory Point designed by Alfred Caldwell, multiple natural areas, and a popular skate park at 31st Street. Several beaches are located within Burnham Park at 12th St., 31st St. (Burroughs), 41st St. (Oakwood), and 57th St.  ",
  "history": "In the mid-1890s, Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham began sketching a magnificent park and boulevard system that would link Jackson Park with downtown. As Chief of Construction for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, Burnham (1846- 1912) had transformed sandy, wind-swept, Jackson Park into the glistening White City. After the fair, Burnham began imagining a more beautiful, orderly, and functional Chicago. Burnham's vision, including a south lakefront park with a series of manmade islands, linear boating harbor, beaches, meadows, and play fields, was published in his seminal 1909 Plan of Chicago. The Plan included lakefront parkland and five islands off the lakeshore. Unfortunately, the five islands were not realized only Island No. 1 was constructed, now known as Northerly Island. The South Park Commissioners began acquiring property for the new park in 1885, it took time to complete. There was land acquisition from private parties and drawn out disputes with the Illinois Central Railroad over riparian rights.\u00a0 Pursuant to a City 1919 ordinance, the South Commissioners Park came in possession of approximately 60 acres of reclaimed land, the ordinance also granted the City\u2019s 10 acre \u201cEast End Park\u201d.\u00a0 Additional property rights and government approvals were finally secured in 1920, and voters approved a $20 million bond issue to create the park. \u00a0The land creation by landfill took several years.\u00a0 By the time, the park was named in honor of Daniel Burnham Park in 1927, only the northern part of the site had been filled. During this period, the South Park Commissioners planned for a stadium on the lakefront.\u00a0 In a letter dated, August 11, 1919 \u201cThe South Park Commissioners of Chicago invite you to enter a limited competition for the commission to prepare working plans and specifications for the construction of a stadium on the Lake Front\u201d.\u00a0 Their decision, as a committee, was announced December 1, 1919, having selected the plans drawn by Holabird and Roche as the best design submitted.\u00a0 By virtue of this award, Holabird and Roche were employed to design Soldier Field.\u00a0 The building is \u201cU\u201d shaped, of gray Benedict cast stone executed in early Greek style of architecture.\u00a0 Soldier Field was formally dedicated on November 27, 1926. Burnham Park became part of the Chicago Park District, in 1934 by virtue of the Park Consolidation Act. In 1933 and 1934, the Century of Progress, Chicago's second World's Fair took place in Burnham Park. In the mid-1930s, the newly created Chicago Park District used federal funds from the Works Progress Administration to complete landfill operations and improve Burnham Park, including the naturalistic Promontory Point landscape by renowned designer Alfred Caldwell. \u00a0In 1935, Mayor Edward J. Kelly began pursuing the idea of a permanent fair in Burnham Park. To facilitate this, the State passed a bill creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority. "

Officially named Buttercup Park in 1974, the park was one of a number of parks named for trees and plants at this time. The buttercup's name derives from English dairy farmers' former belief that if their cows ate these flowers, the animals would produce butter of the same bright, rich yellow. In fact, feeding on buttercups did improve the quality of the butter because the flowers grow only on good pastureland. "

  "history": "In the 1940s, the south side Hyde Park neighborhood saw increasing signs of urban decay. In the following decade, local residents, the University of Chicago, and city agencies organized to stem the tide of deterioration and promote urban renewal. To better serve the community's recreational needs, the City of Chicago purchased this small property on South Woodlawn Avenue. This City park was then transferred the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange Functions Act of 1957. The Chicago Park District, soon improved it with playground equipment and a sand box. The Park District rehabilitated the park by installing a new soft surface playground in 1991. In 1973, the park district officially named the site Butternut Park. At the time, the District\u2019s park naming committee felt that neighborhood children could best relate to park names chosen from nature. The butternut, or white walnut, found throughout eastern North America, is a low, broad tree with a short, thick trunk. The wood of the butternut tree is light and easily worked. Also prized for its beauty, it was often fashioned into elegant carriage interiors in prior centuries. The butternut produces thick-hulled nuts enclosed in sticky, spiny husks. These husks yield a yellow dye that was used by Confederate soldiers to dye their homespun uniforms. The southern troops thus gained the nickname \"Butternuts.\" "

  "description": "At over 140 acres, Marian R. Byrnes is one of the largest natural areas in Chicago. The site, situated in the Jeffery Manor neighborhood, contains marsh, wet prairie, prairie, savanna, and woodland habitats. It is a great place to observe wildlife including frogs, snakes, birds, and deer. This park was previously known as Park No. 562 and Van Vlissingen Prairie.  After undergoing extensive ecological restoration, the park now provides community members with a safe space to relax and connect with nature. A paved multipurpose trail runs the length of the park, giving visitors access to multiple habitats and unique views.  At one time the heart of Chicago and global industry, the Calumet region is a surprising host to many uncommon species of wildlife; bald eagles, black-crowned night herons and Blanding\u2019s turtles are all endangered or protected animals which call the area home for some or all of the year. Additionally, forty percent of Illinois endangered plants can be found in parks, preserves and open land within Calumet. The area holds great potential to become a regionally and nationally recognized place for wildlife habitat restoration and wildlife conservation. Its grand open spaces and historic wetlands are also promising for the development of land and water trails unparalleled in an urban setting. \u00a0These elements together form the basis for creating the Calumet Open Space Reserve, a plan bringing together state and local agencies to protect and enhance 3,900 acres of important wetland, forest and prairie habitat. An emphasis of the Reserve is connectivity \u2013 both in the form of trails for human use, and greenway corridors allowing wildlife to safely cross wider swaths of land without the risks posed by roadways and industrial plants. The Chicago Park District owns and manages over 800 of these acres while the remaining land is split between the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.  Calumet features not only the Chicago Park District\u2019s largest landholdings, but some of its most impressive displays of biodiversity. Habitat variety spans marshes, prairies and woodlands that are host to over 200 species of birds, 20 species of fish, and rare mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Currently the Park District is working alongside sustainable development and conservation experts in addition to community members and other landholders in the region. The Calumet vision is to increase local recreation opportunities while connecting the region to the larger natural landscape to the north, south and west. Community economic development projects are also a priority of the Park District. Perpetuating the Calumet region\u2019s legacy as a hub of production in line with societal needs through contributing to the renewable energy sector and other sustainable businesses is a focus for the present and years to come.  ",
  "history": "In 2011, the City transferred this large site to the Chicago Park District for a park. In 2018, Park Number 562 was officially named in honor of Marian Byrnes. The preservation of this park as an open space is largely thanks to the work of the late Marian Byrnes. A teacher turned community organizer, Marian\u2019s preservation work began in 1979 with a diverse neighborhood coalition to block construction of a CTA bus garage that would demolish half the prairie. The campaign was successful, and Marian became well-known for her environmental advocacy within the Southeast Side community for more than 25 years. We have her tireless efforts to thank for ensuring that we\u2019re able to enjoy this land today. Where now exists industrial plants and retired landfills once laid a vast network of rivers and swales meandering between marshes, lakes and seasonal ponds. (The word \u201ccalumet\u201d is believed to have come from a Potawatomi word for \u201clow body of deep, still water\u201d). Low ridges accommodated drier prairies, but most of the area was flat and grassy at the time of Joliet and Marquette\u2019s expedition through the region in the late 1600s. As predicted by prominent planners in the area such as Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett, Calumet in the post-Civil War era became a national epicenter for manufacturing \u2013 most notably of steel. The vast landscape surrounding the inland Lake Calumet (at that time almost twice its current size and no more than six feet deep at its lowest point) contained all of the elements necessary to become a tremendous hub of production: fresh water for cooling during the manufacturing process, plentiful cheap land, and numerous waterways to connect producers to growing markets. Starting as early as the 1860s, coal from southern Illinois was shipped in large quantities north to Chicago, soon met by iron ore shipped south down the great lakes from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. The first mill in the region was John Brown\u2019s Iron and Steel Mill at 119th Street, and it was followed by many to come. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, completed in 1848, served as the first direct connection between the Great Lakes and international waters through the Gulf of Mexico, precipitating a huge boom in business and population. At its height, the steel industry employed over 200,000 people who moved from across the country and the world to work in the plants. (Even today, with steel production falling by 30 to 40 percent, the amount of steel produced in southeast Chicago and northwest Indiana greatly overshadows any other steel producing region in the nation). The steel that built the Chicago skyline also drove the construction of the railroad, further raising the area\u2019s status as a shipping capital. In fact, as of a 2001 city report, Chicago was the United States\u2019 largest center for intermodal freight shipping \u2013 over 9 million containers are shipped in and out of Calumet annually, twice the amount of any other metropolitan region in the country, and third only to Hong Kong and Singapore. By the 1970s, the demand for steel began to drop as massive urban building and infrastructural projects were largely completed, and aluminum and plastic began to replace steel in popular products such as cans and auto interiors. By 1982, the steel industry in Chicago was only a skeleton of what it once was, and thousands of people lost their jobs. This industry crash affected workers in diverse sectors that either relied on the steel plants for business or served the employees of the steel plants and their families. Aside from mills and processing plants, stores, restaurants and country clubs all went out of business, leaving vacant lots, industrial grounds and many open spaces that remain today. While its industrial roots are important in understanding the current state of the Calumet region, it is also important to recognize the area\u2019s rich cultural and natural history. \u00a0Throughout the 19th century, Calumet remained so sparsely populated that it maintained a reputation for excellent hunting, fishing and recreation. Many local residents practiced subsistence hunting, while businessmen took a one-hour train ride from downtown Chicago to hunt at private hunting reserves. While several of these reserves, such as Woodman\u2019s Tavern and Douglas\u2019s Duck Pond have since been taken over by industry (the Acme Coke plant in South Deering), others like the Southeast Sportsmen\u2019s Club in Hegewisch remain today. Chicagoans from the North Side often vacationed in Calumet, spending the summer at the many hotels or summer homes established around Lake Calumet, which hosted sailing and crew regattas in the summer as well as skating and ice sailing on the lake in the winter. Local and statewide efforts to identify and protect Calumet\u2019s natural resources have been in motion since the later part of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) determined a plot of 3,000 acres to be a natural area of statewide significance. In 1998 the City of Chicago, Chicago Park District and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County adopted City Space: An Open Space Plan for Chicago. As a result of this project, Lake Calumet was identified as the most important wetland and natural area within the city and in urgent need of protection. The Calumet area has attracted federal interest as well, starting with $200,000 given to several local partners by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1999 to develop a sustainable land use plan for nature and industry. In the acquisition and restoration of land, the Chicago Park District and its partners have acquired grants from federal and state agencies as well as private business fulfilling mitigation requirements.

  "history": "California Park, which takes its name from adjacent California Avenue, is one of six parks created by the River Park District. The River Park District was established in 1917, Northwest Chicago residents formed the River District to provide recreational opportunities along the North Branch of the Chicago River and the North Shore Channel and to prevent commercial encroachments there. Soon after its formation, the River Park District began to purchase more than 13 acres south of Irving Park Road, between California Avenue and the North Shore Channel.\u00a0 Acquisition of parkland began in 1917 to 1931 as the River Park District acquired land from different property owners.\u00a0 Although land acquisition dragged on until 1931, development began in 1920, when Leesely Brothers prepared a landscape plan. Improvements were confined largely to plantings until 1927, when the River Park District began construction of an outdoor swimming pool that was, for a time, Illinois's largest. An athletic field, baseball diamonds, and playgrounds followed in 1928, as did a small brick fieldhouse designed by Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld.\u00a0 In 1934, the District was one of 22 independent park systems consolidated into the Chicago Park District. In the 1970s, the Chicago Park District demolished the original fieldhouse and erected a new changing facility in its place. The Park District also constructed an impressive new indoor sports complex, the first of its kind for the District. The structure contains a year-round ice rink for figure skating and hockey, as well as six tennis courts. This facility was officially designated the McFetridge Sports Complex in 1974 for William L. McFetridge, who served as park district president in 1968, and as vice-president for the preceding 22 years.\u00a0 In 2017, the park was expanded with additional property adjacent the River. "

  "history": "Envisioned in 1903 as part of the South Park Commission's revolutionary neighborhood park system, Calumet Park developed slowly.\u00a0 The South Park Commissioners began acquiring land in 1880 and continued to acquire more property for the park until 1943 when streets and alleys were vacated to expand the park.\u00a0 The park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio in 1934 when the 22 park districts were consolidated. \u00a0The Commission conceived the innovative parks to provide social services and breathing spaces to overcrowded immigrant neighborhoods. Landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers created plans for 14 new parks; however, four were delayed, including Calumet Park. Opened in 1905, the first ten included Russell, Mark White, Davis, Armour, and Cornell Squares, and Bessemer, Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, and Hamilton Parks. The Commissioners acquired 40 acres to develop Calumet Park in 1904, but they decided to delay construction. The area's population began a period of rapid growth as European and Mexican immigrants settled in nearby South Chicago to work in the steel mills and railyards. Recognizing this population trend as well as the site's unique Lake Michigan frontage, the Commissioners decided that Calumet Park should be much larger than they had originally planned. Initial temporary improvements allowed people to use the beach and some new playfields. Meanwhile, the Commissioners began slowly enlarging the park through additional property acquisition and landfill. The park slowly evolved to approximately 180 acres in size. The South Park Commission constructed a monumental, classically designed fieldhouse in 1924. After the South Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, additional improvements were made, including substantial work on the park's infrastructure and landscape. In 1993, the Chicago Park District acquired more land to expand the park. The park's name pays tribute to the Calumet region, which encompasses numerous south side community areas and comprises the basin of the Calumet River. The name Calumet comes from the Norman-French word for pipe, \"chamulet.\" Early French explorers who traded with local Native Americans used the term in reference to their \"peace pipes.\" "

  "history": "Canal Origins Park represents the beginning point of the historic Illinois and Michigan (I & M) Canal, a 96-mile long manmade waterway that was built to provide a link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. As explained by authors Blanche Shroerer, Grant Peterson and S. Sydney Bradford, \"Just as the Erie Canal secured New York City's position as the most important shipping center on the East Coast, the Illinois and Michigan Canal guaranteed Chicago's place as the key transportation center in the Middle West.\" The United States Congress made its initial land grant to Illinois in 1822, and ground was finally broken for its construction in 1836. The canal opened in 1848, and its impact on Chicago's growth was soon apparent. The city had only 4470 residents in 1840, when the canal was being built. In 1850, the city had a population of nearly 30,000 and four years later, it had more than doubled to 74,500 residents. The Illinois and Michicgan Canal reached its peak in 1882 when hundreds of boats used the waterway to transport over a million tons of cargo. Although the I & M Canal was rarely used to transport cargo after the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal opened in 1900, it continued to be used by recreational and excursion boats. The United States Congress established the Illinois and Michigan Canal Heritage Corridor in 1984.\u00a0 The City of Chicago landmarked the Illinois and Michigan Canal Chicago Origins site in 1996.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired Canal Origins Park from the State of Illinois in 1999.

When the C.H.A. constructed Altgeld Gardens in between 1943 and 1944, the project quadrupled the housing stock in the Riverdale Community Area. \u00a0Several years later, the Chicago Park District, recognizing the increasing need for recreational opportunities, began to purchase land for park development and acquired land from the C.H.A. in 1950 and in 1956.\u00a0 Today, in addition to maintaining extensive outdoor recreational facilities at Carver Park, the Chicago Park District jointly operates the Altgeld Garden Homes Community Center with the Chicago Housing Authority. George Washington Carver (c.1861-1943), for whom both the park and the neighboring school are named, was a highly influential African American scientist. Born to a slave mother, Carver had to support himself from an early age, but managed to obtain bachelor's and master's degrees from Iowa State Agricultural College once he reached his 30\u2019s. In 1896, he moved to Alabama to direct the newly organized department of agriculture at the Tuskegee Institute. Carver urged southern farmers to plant alternative crops - peanuts, soybeans, sweet potatoes - to replenish soil devastated by years of uninterrupted cotton production. When there proved to be little commercial demand for these crops, Carver embarked on extensive research to develop marketable derivative products. Carver's work at Tuskegee dramatically altered agricultural production in the south and greatly stimulated the region's economy. "

  "history": "The City of Chicago transferred this park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957. \u00a0Officially, designated Cedar Park in 1973, the site was one of several parks named for trees and plants at this time. The term \"cedar\" is a vernacular name used for a group of unrelated conifers (cone-bearing trees) with fragrant wood. Cedars include several junipers and arborvitae. The northern white cedar grows widely in central and eastern Canada and the northeastern and Midwestern United States. Brought to France in 1536, the northern white cedar was among the first North American plants to be introduced in Europe. The eastern red cedar, found in the United States as far west as the Dakotas, is used to line closets and chests because its smell repels moths. True cedars - as opposed to junipers and arbor vitae - are not native to North America. "

As early as 1906, the Special Park Commission was managing a one-acre greenspace south of the tracks. When the railroad erected a new station several years later, the commission improved another acre-and-a-half north of the tracks and depot. Landscape architect and commission member Jens Jensen developed a park plan, and the Commission installed a driveway and sidewalks; lawn and shrubs; benches; and a \"drinking fountain for man and beast.\" The Commission also reconstructed the southern parcel. Initially known as Norwood Park No. 3, the property was soon designated The Railway Garden. \u00a0The City of Chicago acquired property in 1930. The shaded park, still used exclusively for passive recreation, was transferred from the City of Chicago to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange Functions Act.\u00a0 In 1970, the Chicago Park District acquired more land to expand the park.\u00a0 In 1975, the park district renamed the site Centennial Park at the request of the Norwood Park Citizen's Association.

Garfield Park, created by the West Park Commission in 1869, is the midpoint between Humboldt and Douglas Parks on Chicago's grand boulevard system.

Located only a few blocks from Wrigley Field, the debris-strewn site included a dilapidated alley and vacant land adjacent to Graceland Cemetery. The City and Park District financed the project, supplemented by donations from Cubs Care, the Graceland Cemetery Trustees, and the Chauncey and Marion Deering McCormick Foundation. \u00a0\u00a0The Park District leases this park from the City and the CTA. The 1991 project transformed the half-mile stretch of land into a linear park with native trees, grasses, wildflowers, jogging and walking paths, new sewers, lighting, and a new alley running underneath the elevated trusses. The project also included a dual-purpose basketball court and parking lot. The Chicago Park District named the site Challenger Park in memory of the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster of January 28, 1986. The Challenger crew included six astronauts, Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, and Gregory Jarvis and a teacher, Christa McAuliffe.

  "history": "In 1920, the Lincoln Park Commission converted a deserted semi-professional baseball field into Chase Park. Known as Gunther Park, the ball field was home to the Niesen-Gunther team beginning in 1905. The facility went out of business in 1913, during the construction of Chicago's north side professional baseball field, Wrigley Field. A community member suggested the conversion of the old ball field into a park in 1914, and several years later the Ravenswood Improvement Association and some local officials petitioned for the park. The Lincoln Park Commission finally began land acquisition in 1920 and continued until 1925 as property was acquired and streets and alleys were vacated to expand the park. Within the next two years, tennis courts, a playground, an athletic field, a wading pool, and a fieldhouse were constructed in Chase Park. In 1934, the Lincoln Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District. The Park district demolished Chase Park's original fieldhouse and replaced it with a new building in 1976. Chase Park was one of seven neighborhood parks created by the Lincoln Park Commission. Five of them were named in honor of President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet members. Chase Park honors Salmon P. Chase (1803-1873), who served as Lincoln's secretary of the treasury from 1861 to 1864. In late 1864, Lincoln appointed Chase Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Early in his career, Chase became well known as a defender of runaway slaves and leader in the anti-slavery movement. As one of his initial acts as Chief Justice, he appointed John Rock, the nation's first African-American attorney to argue before the Supreme Court. "

  "history": "By the late 1950s, the South Shore neighborhood had long been considered \u201cone of the finest residential areas\u201d in Chicago. Civic organizations worked closely with the City of Chicago to keep it that way, despite changing demographics at that time. The City of Chicago acquired several residential lots on South Dante Avenue to create a new playlot park in the South Shore community. Ownership and management of the small park transferred from the City to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957. \u00a0The site was soon improved with playground apparatus, trees, lawn and benches. On November 24, 1960, the Chicago Tribune published an article entitled \u201cModern Playlots Are Open\u201d featuring a photograph of children playing on the merry-go-ground at the park at E. 70th Street and S. Dante Avenue, which had not yet been named. The Chicago Park District officially named the site Chestnut Park in 1973. It was one of a number of park properties named for trees and plants at this time. Chestnuts take the form of both trees and shrubs. Five of the 14 chestnut species are native to North America. The American Chestnut, the \"spreading chestnut tree\" of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, The Village Blacksmith, once grew to a height of 100 feet, with a broad, rounded crown. Formerly prominent in the forests of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the American Chestnut is now somewhat rare due to chestnut blight. "

  "history": "Landscape architect Mimi McKay and architect Tannys Langdon designed Chicago Women\u2019s Park and Garden, which opened to the public in 2000. The small scale of the park and its lushly planted borders enhance the space\u2019s contemplative feeling. The centerpiece of the park's design is the Botanical Gardens Fountain with a copper-coated cast iron basin created by Robinson Iron of Alexander City, Alabama. A winding path along the perimeter of the site serves as a metaphor of a woman as she moves in and out of traditional boundaries and roles through the course of her life. In 2011, the Chicago Park District installed a monument in the park in homage to Jane Addams (1860 \u2013 1935), Chicago\u2019s famous social reformer and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Internationally renowned artist Louise Bourgeios (1911 \u2013 2010) created the artwork, which was first dedicated on the city\u2019s lakefront in 1996. The sculpture was commissioned by the B.F. Ferguson Fund of the Art Institute of Chicago. Representatives of the Art Institute selected Bourgeios because they knew that the surrealist artist would portray Jane Addams through a symbolically powerful artwork rather than a depictive figurative sculpture. Bourgeios produced a series of carved granite hands that sit on rough-hewn granite bases. The monument, which is also known as \u201cHelping Hands,\u201d recognizes the humanity of Addams\u2019 efforts, as well as the large number of people she helped. Speaking about her work in a 2007 PBS Documentary film, \u201cFrom Art in the 21st Century,\u201d Louise Bourgeois said, \u201cA work of art does not have to be explained\u2026 If you do not have any feeling about this, I cannot explain it to you. If this doesn't touch you, I have failed.\u201d \"Helping Hands\" entails six rough hewn stone bases which each support a hand or series of carved black granite hands representing a broad range of people of different ages and backgrounds. The current installation reflects the artist\u2019s original arrangement of the sculptures and their positions. Describing the significance of the artist and her approach to this project, Michael Darling, a Chief Curator at Chicago\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art explains, \u201cLouise Bourgeois is one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, primarily because she has addressed central aspects of the human condition in her work. Channeling the issues raised during her tumultuous childhood, she has focused her work on ideas about inter-personal communication, nurturing, alienation, belonging, motherhood, sensuality, birth and death, among many other themes. This sculpture is an excellent example of how she suggests these concepts in a truly universal form\u2014through the motif of the human hand.\u201d "

  "history": "Chopin Park was created by the Old Portage Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. \u00a0In 1931, the Old Portage Park District purchased just over 9 acres and vacated alleys and streets for the future park. This park is located in what was then a predominantly Polish southeastern corner of the rapidly growing Portage Park Community Area. The park was soon well equipped with baseball and football fields, tennis and horseshoe courts, and a playground. The site also included an impressive brick fieldhouse with a 300-seat assembly/banquet hall and various game and clubrooms. The Georgian Revival-style fieldhouse was identical to those at the Old Portage Park District's nearby Shabbona and Wilson Parks. Recognizing the Polish heritage of many area residents, the Old Portage Park District named the park for the great Polish-born French composer and pianist Frederic Francois Chopin (1810--1849). A child prodigy, Chopin first played in public at the age of eight, and began composing shortly thereafter. He is best known for his many compositions for solo piano. In the mid-1930s, not long after Chopin Park became part of the unified Chicago Park District, the new agency remodeled the fieldhouse. Over the years, the facility drew neighborhood residents for a wide variety of indoor activities, including pre-school and mothers' clubs, gymnastics, social dancing, crafts, citizenship classes. Particularly appropriate given its name, a local orchestra practiced at the fieldhouse, performing concerts in the auditorium. The Chicago Park District also made various outdoor improvements, including constructing a wading pool with sand pits and shelters in 1948, installing a basketball court in 1975, and regularly rehabilitating various park facilities and greenspaces.

Clarendon originated as a municipal beach. During the 19th century, Lake Michigan was rarely used for swimming because the heavily polluted Chicago River flowed into it. The new Sanitary Canal corrected the problem in 1900, and the Health Department began creating municipal beaches to provide the city's growing population with access to swimming as well as showers and changing facilities. In 1905, the city's Special Park Commission took over management of municipal beaches. Several years later, the Commission began planning a state-of-the-art facility, visiting well-known municipal beaches throughout the nation such as Belle Isle Beach, Detroit; the New York City Beach at Coney Island; and the Atlantic City Bath Houses. In 1916, the city opened the Clarendon Municipal Beach, featuring an impressive brick building with two stately towers, separate open-air locker areas for men and women, and two smaller buildings housing a laundry and a children's playroom. Accommodating more than 9,000 swimmers and a promenade for thousands of spectators, the facility provided bathing suits, towels, and lockers for the charge of ten cents per adult. The beach remained popular until the late 1930s, when the Chicago Park District expanded Lincoln Park north to Foster Avenue, thereby eliminating Clarendon's lake frontage. At that time, the city converted the facility into a community center, adding gymnasiums, clubrooms, a playground, and an athletic field. The Chicago Park District assumed ownership of the Clarendon Community Center in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The Park District also leases the northern most portion of the park from the City Department of Water Management. \u00a0A major renovation project in 1972 resulted in the removal of the building's most distinguishing features such as its tile roof and towers. In recent years, the Park District has made the building accessible to people with disabilities, and upgraded the ball fields and playground. "

  "history": "Just before 1900, the City of Chicago acquired a parcel of land on West Jackson Boulevard in the Austin community. Having used the site for many years as a Water Pipe and District Yard, the city decided to develop the property as parkland for the rapidly growing neighborhood, transferring it to the Bureau of Parks and Recreation in 1923. Within a few years, the property was equipped with a small recreation building with open sand court wings, playground apparatus, and a playing field that was flooded for ice-skating in winter. Expanding the park onto several adjacent lots in 1928, the bureau constructed an oval wading pool with a pergola shelter. The open wings of the recreation structure were enclosed in 1947, creating a year-round facility. The Chicago Park District began leasing the park in 1960. A decade later, the park district replaced the deteriorating wading pool with a larger swimming pool. A soft surface playground was installed in 1991, and trees planted several years later. The park honors John S. Clark (1892-1960), who was elected alderman of the surrounding 30th Ward in 1917, at the early age of 25. (At the time, the city regularly named parks for the sitting aldermen of the wards in which the properties were located.) In 1927, Clark became chairman of the City Council's powerful Finance Committee. He served the 30th Ward until 1934, when he was elected Cook County Assessor, a position he held for 20 years. Throughout his life, Clark actively participated in civic affairs on Chicago's west side. "

Clover is an herb characterized by trifoliate leaves and dense heads of flowers. Clover is a common pasture plant and its blossoms are a favorite of bees. Red clover is said to signify \"dignity,\" white clover, \"promise.\" The ancient Celts and Druids believed that clover, especially four-leaved clover, was sacred, giving rise to the modern notion that a four-leaved clover will bring good luck.

Following the Bureau's standard practice, the site was named for adjacent Clybourn Avenue. The street honors Archibald Clybourne (1802-1872), an early Chicago butcher who built a rambling 20-room mansion in 1836. Clybourne was a justice of the peace, a school trustee, and Chicago's first constable. Initially installing a basketball court and playground equipment, the City added a sandbox and wading pool by 1950. \u00a0In 1957, the city transferred Clybourn Park to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.

The following year, the Park District named the newly improved park for John L. Cochran (1857-1923), Edgewater's primary developer. Born in Sacramento, California and educated in Philadelphia, Cochran moved to Chicago, becoming one of the first directors of the Chicago Title and Trust Company. Beginning in 1885, Cochran bought and subdivided land along the lakeshore north of Chicago. To draw residential buyers, he constructed wide streets, stone sidewalks, and a drainage system.

By the late 1890s, the museum was not doing very well, and a group of investors organized to find a way to re-use old Gothic prison building. An earlier Coliseum hall burned down in 1897, so the investors decided to convert the Civil War museum into a new hall for sports, political rallies, and other special events. President William McKinley dedicated the new Chicago Coliseum in August of 1900, and it soon hosted Wild West shows, political conventions, track and field and other sports events. The Coliseum remained in operation until 1982, and over the years, activities in the building hockey, basketball, roller skating, and rock concerts featuring popular groups such as the Grateful Dead and the Doors. The Chicago Park District acquired the .75-acre site in 2000, and hired the Site Design Group to create a plan for the new park.

",
  "history": "Columbus Park is considered the masterpiece of Jens Jensen, now known as dean of Prairie-style landscape architecture. The project, Jensen's only opportunity to create an entirely new large park in Chicago, represents the culmination of years of his conservation efforts and design experimentation.\u00a0 In 1912 and 1913, the West Park District acquired the land for Columbus Park.\u00a0 The streets and alleys within the park boundary were vacated for the park in 1916.\u00a0 Columbus Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934. Appointed as West Park Commission General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect in 1905, Jensen re-designed Humboldt, Garfield, and Douglas Parks and began creating small parks such as Eckhart and Dvorak. After losing political support in 1910, he shifted his role to consulting landscape architect.\u00a0 The commissioners acquired 144 acres of farmland at the western boundary of Chicago. They named the new park for Christopher Columbus (c. 1451-1506), the famous Italian explorer who \"discovered\" America while in the service of Spain. Jensen's vision for Columbus Park was inspired by the unimproved site's natural history and topography. Convinced that it was an ancient beach, Jensen designed a series of berms, like glacial ridges, encircling the flat interior part of the park. In the center area, following the traces of sand dune, he created a \"prairie river\" flowing from two brooks. Two natural-looking waterfalls, with ledges of stratified stonework, represent the source of the river. Throughout the park, Jensen included native plants. Jensen also included programming elements emulating nature. Broad prairie-like meadows provide a golf course and ball fields. He designed an outdoor theatre, known as the \"player's green,\" for plays and other performances. In the children's playground area, Jensen included his favorite feature, the council ring, a circular stone bench for storytelling and campfires. In 1952, the nine acres at the park's southern boundary were acquired by Cook County to make way for the Eisenhower Expressway. Despite the loss of some land and other changes to the park at that time, Columbus Park still conveys Jensen's genius. "

A prominent and influential business organization, the club participated in various projects to improve and beautify the city, including sponsoring Daniel H. Burnham's seminal 1909 Plan of Chicago. For the playground project, club members donated $10,000, the largest gift for such an effort at the time. The park was named Lincoln Playground, for adjacent Wolcott Avenue, previously known as Lincoln Street. In 1889, the club donated the park to the City of Chicago, stipulating that it be named in honor of the Commercial Club, and that the name never be changed again.\u00a0 In 1929, the club donated more land to expand the park with the same stipulation. The Commercial Club remained active in supporting this and other playgrounds for many years. It donated $1,000 for an ornamental fence around Commercial Club Park in 1908, and made annual $200 gifts to provide prizes for athletic contests and competitions in numerous municipal parks. When Commercial Club Park first opened to the public, it included playground equipment, sand courts, a shelter house, and a playfield that was flooded for skating in the winter. By 1938, the city had constructed a fieldhouse in the park, providing a gymnasium and play room. Title of Commercial Club Playground Park of Chicago was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.

Local community groups solicited the help of the non-profit, Open Lands Project, in preserving the green space. In 1969, Open Lands proposed to purchase and develop the property as parkland, and then donate the improved site to the Chicago Park District. It proved easier, however, to transfer the land directly from the City of Chicago to the Chicago Park District in 1973. The project came to fruition in 1973. The Open Lands Project hired landscape architects Linstrum & Tarnow to design the new park. Conceived as a \"model vest-pocket park,\" the plan retained the existing trees, including an impressive black oak, and incorporated new plantings, a walkway, small grassy playfields, and a small playground area. In 1992, the park district rehabilitated the park's landscape and installed a new soft surface playground. Cornell Park's name recognizes its location on South Cornell Avenue. The street honors Paul Cornell (1822-1904) a lawyer and real estate developer who founded the Hyde Park community. Instrumental in securing approval of the state bill, which established the South Park Commission in 1869, Cornell served as a member of its board for 14 years. A second park, Cornell Square, also bears his name. "

  "history": "The South Park District acquired land for the park in 1904 and alleys and streets were vacated for the park in 1909.\u00a0 The South Park Commission created Cornell Square in 1904 as part of a revolutionary neighborhood park system, which improved the difficult living conditions in Chicago's congested tenement districts. The innovative parks provided not only beautiful \"breathing spaces,\" but also public bathing, the City's first branch libraries, classes and vocational training, inexpensive hot meals, health care, and a variety of recreational programs.\u00a0 Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. designed the entire system. Five of the first ten properties, which opened in 1905, were known as squares because they were smaller than ten acres in size; the other five, which were larger than ten acres, were considered parks. In addition to Cornell Square, these were Mark White, Russell, Davis, and Armour Squares, and Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, Bessemer, and Hamilton Parks. Cornell Square was named in honor of Paul Cornell (1822--1904), a lawyer and real estate developer who was a leading force behind the creation of the South Park System. In the mid-1850s, Cornell bought land south of Chicago and developed the community of Hyde Park. He arranged to have the Illinois Central Railroad provide commuter service to the newly developed area. Cornell believed that parks would provide \"lungs to the great city and its future generations.\" He was instrumental in securing approval of the state bill, which established the South Park Commission in 1869, and served as a member of its board for 14 years.

Two other community groups, the Washington Heights and Ridge Improvement Associations, voiced concerns about the proposal. Finally, in the spring of 1927, the Beverly Hills Improvement Association gathered the signatures of 525 area residents favoring the park's creation. Persuaded, the Ridge Park Board agreed to proceed, and in 1928 and 1929 purchased more than three acres of property.\u00a0 Acquisition was initiated in 1925 and was completed in 1936.\u00a0 Park plans submitted by the Beverly Hills Improvement Association and adopted by the Ridge Park District in 1933 called for a playground set in an attractive greenspace. Although the playground was apparently never built, the Chicago Park District installed tennis courts shortly after it took over in 1934. In 1953, the property was officially designated Longwood Park, a name it had held informally since the 1920\u2019s. Nearly 40 years later, the Chicago Park District honored the request of the Beverly Improvement Association to rename the site Cosme Park. Margaret Cosme, a neighborhood child, died tragically after being struck by a moving vehicle. Cosme's father, along with her grandfather, Luke Cosme, a longtime Park District employee, had helped construct the park's new baseball diamond in the 1980s.

The Wrightwood Avenue Improvement Club petitioned for a fieldhouse, but none was built until 1954. Cragin Park is named for the surrounding neighborhood, which in turn took its name from a 19th-century industrial suburb. The Cragin brothers built their metals manufacturing plant along the tracks of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad in 1883.

Noted landscape architect Jens Jensen, who had prepared plans for the Calumet District's Bohn Park and Prospect Gardens, designed a plan for the park in 1915. Landscape improvements began shortly thereafter. In 1916, the Calumet Park District officially named the site Crescent Park for the drive that had once arced through it. (The east and west sections of the drive have since been renamed Oakley and Bell Avenues.) The Calumet Park District transferred Crescent Park to the new Chicago Park District in 1934. In 1935, the Chicago Park District began adding recreational features. These facilities are nestled into the natural grades of the Tinley Ground moraine back slope.

The park, the housing complex, and nearby Dearborn Street all pay homage to General Henry Dearborn (1751-1829), Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of War from 1801 to 1809. The early Federal garrison at Chicago also bore his name. Constructed near the mouth of the Chicago River in 1803, Fort Dearborn was built to protect the strategic trade routes that passed through Chicago. During the War of 1812, however, Potowatamis raided and burned the fort, ambushing fleeing soldiers and settlers in what has since been known as the Fort Dearborn Massacre. The Federal government rebuilt the fort in 1816, and the garrison stood until the government decommissioned it twenty years later. "

  "history": "DeBow Park's south side Avalon Park community was little more than swampland until 1900, when the new 79th Street sewer provided much-needed drainage for the area. By 1920, Avalon Park had nearly 3,000 residents. A decade later, that number had increased to more than 10,000. Although development slowed during World War II, it surged again after the war. Avalon Park experienced rapid change after 1960, as African-Americans began to move into the neighborhood. In 1972, the Chicago Park District authorized the purchase of this half-acre site in Avalon Park, one of 36 properties identified for park development in under-served city neighborhoods at that time. Using grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the park district acquired the property in 1973. Within a few years, the park included a shaded greenspace and playground equipment. In 1989, the park district officially designated the property DeBow Park in tribute to Judge Russell R. DeBow (1889--1984). DeBow, a graduate of Illinois University at Normal and DePaul University Law School, worked for several federal agencies before becoming the first African-American to hold an administrative position on the staff of the mayor of Chicago in 1965. In 1971, DeBow was appointed Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court by the Illinois Supreme Court. Three years later, he was elected to the position, becoming supervising judge of the pretrial section of the Law Division in 1978. Among DeBow's many accolades for public service were the Cook County Bar Association's Edward H. Wright Award; the Mary McLeod Bethune Merit Award from the National Council of Negro Women; the Distinguished Alumni Award from Illinois State University; the Billiken Parade Appreciation Award; and the Chicago Daily Defender Humanitarianism Award.

  "history": "In the 1880s, Samuel E. Gross, a real estate speculator who has been considered the P.T. Barnum of working-class communities, began developing the Dauphin Park Subdivision. Donating a long strip of land to the city as parkland, Gross named the park, adjacent street, and entire development in honor of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, derived from the title for the first born and heir to the throne of France. Although the Dauphin Park community was soon settled by Hungarian and Irish railroad workers, the parkland remained largely unimproved for many years. In 1913, the city's Special Park Commission finally began extensive work on the 5-acre strip, constructing a drainage system and filling and grading the land. Within the next few years, lawn, trees, and shrubs were planted, and tennis courts installed. By the 1940s, the city created a skating pond in the center of the parkway during wintertime. As many as 4,790 people skated there per season. In 1957, the city turned Dauphin Park over to the Chicago Park District along with more than 250 other properties pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. After adding a children's playground in the 1960s, the park district created a basketball court and made substantial landscape improvements a decade later.\u00a0 In 2015, the Chicago Park District acquired more land to expand the park. In 2005, the Chicago Park District renamed the park in honor of Lorraine Dixon. Lorraine L. Dixon (1950- 2001) was an energetic Chicago alderman who committed her life to public service and transcended racial and gender barriers. After receiving a Bachelor\u2019s of Science Degree from Chicago State University in 1972, Lorraine began working as an instructor at the Chicago Urban Skills Institute and went on to work in the City of Chicago\u2019s Department of Human Services.\u00a0 She became the City\u2019s Chief Zoning Administrator, and later, Chief of Staff for the City Council Committee on Energy.

The following year, she won was elected for a second term, and also went to serve a third term.\u00a0 As Alderman, she was extremely involved in her community\u2014 leading clean-up campaigns and anti-crime marches and serving as Grand Marshal of the Annual Back-to-School Parade. In 1994, she was the first woman to head the City Council Committee on Budget and Government Operations. She also served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on MBE/WBE and Affirmative Action matters for the City Council, and had the distinction of becoming both the first woman and first African American to serve as President Pro Tempore of the City Council. Ms. Dixon was known for finding creative ways to increase opportunity and improve the quality of life for her constituents. She was active in numerous civic and political organizations including the Women\u2019s Auxiliary of South Shore Hospital, United Negro College Fund, League of Black Women Voters and Cook County Young Democrats.

Dogwood trees can be found throughout the temperate regions of the United States and Canada. The alternate-leaf dogwood is native to the Chicago region and much of the northeastern United States. Perhaps more well-known is the eastern flowering dogwood, found from Massachusetts south to Florida and west to Texas.

  "history": "In 2013, the Chicago Park District acquired land for the park from two Illinois corporations.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District has worked closely with the School Street Advisory Council, Alderman Thomas M.

The advisory council formally requested that the new park be named in honor of Margaret Donahue (1892 \u2013 1978), one of the first women executives in major league baseball. The Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners complied with the request, and the park was officially named in 2014. Born on a farm in Huntley, Illinois, she moved to Chicago at the age of 16 to find a job as a secretary. In 1919, with only one year of high school a year of secretarial training, and a brief position at a laundry, Donahue was hired as a stenographer by William Veeck, President of the Chicago Cubs (and father of longtime Cubs owner Bill Veeck). At the time, the only other woman who worked for the Cubs was the team\u2019s bookkeeper. That woman soon left, and Donahue took over, performing as both secretary and bookkeeper. She quickly took over many responsibilities including ticket sales, stock transfers, providing press passes, and handling gate receipts for other Wrigley Field events such as Chicago Bears professional football games. Before long, she was traveling with the Cubs. In 1926, Veeck promoted Donahue to corporate secretary, an unprecedented role for a woman in the major leagues at that time. She brought many innovations to professional baseball such as season tickets, providing off-site ticket locations, and selling reduced priced tickets for children. When Donahue was promoted to vice president of the Chicago Cubs in 1950, she was the first woman in this role in the major league to have come up through the ranks. Donahue retired in 1958, prompting Phillip K. Wrigley to issue a proclamation describing her as a \u201cnationally acknowledged authority on the intricacies of baseball rules and regulations.\u201d When Donahue died in 1978, she was eulogized by Jack Brickhouse on WGN.

  "history": "In 1960, the Central Park and St. Louis Improvement Association suggested the creation of a park and school within a manufacturing district that would soon be redeveloped for residential housing. Winston Homes, Inc. agreed to sell four acres at the corner of St. Louis Avenue and 77th Street for the project. By the end of 1967, the Chicago Park District had acquired three acres and the Board of Education had acquired one acre to create a jointly-operated school-park. However, the Board of Education soon began questioning the need for a new school here. The Park District improved its three acres and named the site Dooley Park in 1974. After the contiguous Board of Education parcel remained unimproved for years, the Park District acquired the land to expand Dooley Park in 1991. In 1999, the Board of Education moved forward on its school-park plan. The Park District transferred two and a half acres to the Board of Education, which is constructing a building that will be jointly programmed by both agencies. \u00a0In 2003, the Chicago Park District transferred a portion of the park to the City of Chicago.

He rejoined the navy, and in 1954, at the end of the war in Indochina, Dooley assisted in evacuating refugees from communist North Viet Nam. Dooley wrote a best-selling book, Deliver Us From Evil, describing this work. After resigning from the navy, Dooley used the book's proceeds to establish a medical clinic in Laos in 1956. He went on to establish additional hospitals in other remote regions, traveling to the U.S. only often enough to raise money for these efforts. Dooley's work was cut short by his death from cancer at the young age of 34. "

Helen Doria (1951 \u2013 2012) devoted her life to enriching Chicago with strong cultural programs that unified individuals, groups, and neighborhoods throughout the city. The oldest of eight children, Helen was born and raised in Chicago. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Mundelein College in 1973, she began her career as a grass root activist in Rogers Park. While serving as an aide to then 49th Ward Alderman David Orr, she assisted the Chicago Park District on the acquisition of the Berger Park mansions and development of the Cultural Center. She went on to work for the City of Chicago\u2019s Department of Special Events and Department of Cultural Affairs, spearheading such initiatives as the Sister City\u2019s program. She then joined the staff of the Chicago Park District and brought new life to the district\u2019s cultural programming.

In 2004, Helen Doria became the first Executive Director of Millennium Park and she helped make the new park an exciting and democratic space with a broad array of activities and offerings for Chicagoans and visitors. She was instrumental in initiating the Made in Chicago: World Class Concert Series that continues in Millennium Park today. Toward the end of her life, Helen became a consultant on arts, culture and public spaces, taking a lead role in development of the 606 and working with businesses, not-for-profit organizations and governmental agencies to make the arts an accessible part of urban life.

  "history": "In 1869, the Illinois state legislature established the West Park Commission, which was responsible for three large parks and interlinking boulevards. Later that year, the commissioners named the southernmost park in honor of Stephen A. Douglas (1813-1861). Best remembered for his pre-Civil War presidential defeat by Abraham Lincoln despite superb oratorical skills, Douglas was a United States Senator who helped bring the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago. \u00a0In 2020, the community requested that the park be renamed to honor historical abolitionists, Anna and Frederick Douglass. Park Design In 1871, designer William Le Baron Jenney completed plans for the entire West Park System which included Douglas, Garfield, and Humboldt parks. Jenney's engineering expertise was especially helpful for transforming Douglas Park's poor natural site into parkland. He had sand and manure from the Chicago Stock Yards added to the marshy site. In the center of the landscape, Jenney created a picturesque lake. A small section of the park was formally opened in 1879. In 1895, members of several German turners' clubs petitioned for an outdoor gymnasium in Douglas Park. The following year, this resulted in the construction of one of Chicago's first public facilities with an outdoor gymnasium, swimming pool, and natatorium. By the turn of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with political graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as Dean of the Prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Blvd., and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Ave. and Sacramento Dr. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the juncture of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Ave. and playfields to the south. At the entrance to the garden, the area closest to the busy roadway intersection, Jensen placed a monumental garden shelter, known as Flower Hall, and a formal reflecting pool. The designer of the structure is unknown, however, it was possibly Jensen himself, or his friend, Prairie School architect Hugh Garden. East of the building, the garden becomes more naturalistic. Jensen included perennial beds, a lily pool, and unique Prairie-style benches. In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed a fieldhouse in Douglas Park. The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Humboldt and LaFollette Park Fieldhouses, and the On Leong Chinese Merchant's Association Building in Chinatown. In 1934, Douglas Park became part of the Chicago Park District, when the city's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide agency. Park Name On September 9, 2020, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners voted to officially remove the name of Stephen Douglas from the park. On November 18, 2020, in response to a community request, the Board voted to officially name the park in honor of Anna and Frederick Douglass. In 1818, Frederick Douglass was born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, of mixed race, into slavery on the eastern shore of Maryland. After Douglass taught himself to read and write, he found work at the docks in Baltimore. It was there he met a free black woman named Anna Murray. She had been born free, to parents who were former slaves. Ms. Murray worked as a laundress and a housekeeper, gaining independent financial security for herself. She provided funds to Frederick, which he used to disguise himself as a sailor and escape slavery. Ms. Murray followed Frederick to New York, where they married and established a household. When they later settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and in an effort to hide his identity, he dropped his middle name and they changed their last name to Douglass. Throughout their 44-year marriage, Anna provided the support system for Frederick\u2019s growing work as an orator and abolitionist, maintaining their household and raising their five children. Douglass began reading The Liberator, an abolitionist publication, and began attending abolitionist meetings. Thereafter, the Anti-Slavery Society hired Douglass as a paid lecturer. This was his beginning as an orator; he would become one of the most famous orators of his time. He focused on the abolishment of slavery, the promoting of the moral and intellectual improvement of people of color, and women\u2019s rights. Frederick Douglass also published three autobiographies. Douglass knew that the Emancipation Proclamation was a revolutionary document. In 1865, Douglass attended Lincoln\u2019s second Inaugural Speech, and often quoted from the speech. Upon hearing of Lincoln\u2019s death, Douglass was said to feel the death as both a personal and national calamity. "

  "history": "Dubkin Park was one of four city \"baby playgrounds\" created in 1934 and 1935, and financed by the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission. Initially known as Ashland Baby Park for its location along Ashland Avenue in the Rogers Park neighborhood, the shaded greenspace featured a small, sheltered sandbox for young children, and benches for the comfort of their mothers. The city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation maintained the privately-owned site until 1968, when the Chicago Park District purchased the tiny triangle with funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1974, the park district renamed the property Dubkin Playlot in honor of Leonard Dubkin (1904--), a local community organizer and strong proponent of the park. His friends and neighbors who frequented the park knew him as a \"sidewalk naturalist.\" He was in fact a well-known nature writer, who authored My Secret Places: One Man's Love Affair with Nature in the City in 1972. For many years, Dubkin also wrote a column called \"The Birds and Bees\" for the local Lerner Newspaper. "

  "history": "The elegant south side Douglas community became densely populated during World War I, as an influx of African-Americans from the rural south settled there. Many lovely mansions were quickly divided into multiple unit apartments to accommodate the large numbers of new arrivals to the area. The Douglas community went through further decline during the Great Depression and experienced additional population increases during World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a number of neighborhood revitalization initiatives emerged. Among them, the Lake Meadows Apartments were created by private developers and included 2,000 new housing units, shops, and a commercial building. In 1956, the Board of Education constructed Paul Dunbar High School nearby. Four years later, the Chicago Land Clearance Commission worked with the Chicago Park District to create an adjacent park.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired the 20-acre site from 1958-1963 as land was acquired and streets and alleys were vacated to expand the park, and transformed into Dunbar Park between 1964 and 1966. Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906), one of the nation's first critically acclaimed African-American authors, was popular with white and black audiences alike. The son of former slaves, Dunbar was raised in Dayton, Ohio. Although he was the only African-American student to attend public high school there, he was selected as editor of the school paper and president of the literary society. While working as an elevator operator, Dunbar self-published his first book of poetry, Oak and Ivy, selling copies to passengers to underwrite the costs. In 1893, Dunbar was invited to Chicago to recite poetry to audiences at the World's Columbian Exposition. Publishing two more volumes of poetry, Dunbar began giving readings throughout the United States and England. He went on to publish nine more books of poetry, five novels, four short story collections, and a play before his death at the early age of 33. "

  "history": "In 1945, at the end of World War II, Robert J. Dunham, President of the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners, announced a major new initiative to bring the benefits of parks and recreation to every neighborhood in the city. As part of this effort to create new parks for the first time in many years, a citizens' advisory committee submitted a list of recommended sites in 1948. Among them was a 14-acre site in the rapidly growing Portage Park neighborhood. The Park District had to condemn land from reluctant home owners in 1929, 1948, and in 1956, an issue which even led to protesters filing into a 1945 board meeting. \u00a0Then the Chicago Park District acquired land for the park from 1949-1953.\u00a0 After the entire site was acquired in 1956 after land acquisition and condemnation, the Engineering Department created a plan for the new park. The Park District began some improvements in 1953, however all of the houses on the site were not razed until 1958. By the early 1960s, the park included an athletic field, a children's playground, tennis courts, and a comfort station. Finally, in 1976, the district constructed a modern fieldhouse in the park. When the Park District's naming committee made its proposals in the early 1950s, they suggested that one of the new parks be named in honor of Robert J. Dunham (1876-1948). Born and raised in Chicago, Dunham was the oldest son of Captain James Sears Dunham, one of the city's leading mariners. Dunham became a prominent Chicago businessman, responsible for organizing the Universal Oil Products Company. He entered public life during the Depression as Chairman of the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission in 1933. The following year, the city's 22 independent park boards were consolidated into the Chicago Park District, and Dunham was appointed its first president, continuing to serve in that capacity through 1945.

  "history": "Chicago's Ashburn community remained sparsely populated until the late 1940s, when industrial development on the southwest side and in nearby suburbs brought a surge of residential construction to the area. Ashburn's population increased an amazing 400% during the 1950s. In early 1957, a local civic group, the West Ridge Association, appeared before the Chicago Park District to advocate park development in their quickly-growing neighborhood. Before year's end, the park district used park improvement bond funds to acquire several city blocks between 83rd and 84th Streets. Additional acreage was provided by greening over the three city streets that ran through the park site. \u00a0In 1958, the City of Chicago had streets vacated to acquire land for the park.\u00a0 In 1959, the Engineering Department developed a site plan that included a playground, horseshoe courts, and an athletic field. Improvements followed shortly thereafter. In 1962, the site was named for Martin P. Durkin (1894--1955), president of the AFL Plumbers and Pipefitters Union, who lived near the park. Durkin served as President Eisenhower's first Secretary of Labor. Durkin Park's development coincided with the construction of Crerar Elementary School just to the west. From the beginning, the park and the adjacent school property have been jointly operated by the Park District and the Chicago Board of Education. Though Crerar School closed for several years in the 1980s, the Park District continued to use the school property with few interruptions, and the school building has since reopened as Linhart Elementary School. The school's gymnasium doubles as the Durkin Park fieldhouse during non-school hours. "

  "history": "Durso Park's Near North Side community is among the oldest sections of Chicago. Filled with industry and worker housing before 1900, the western portion of the community became increasingly blighted during the first decades of the 20th century. In an effort to rid the area of its deteriorating housing, the Chicago Housing Authority in 1943 constructed the Frances Cabrini Homes, a 586-unit complex of row houses and garden apartments. Fifteen years later, CHA expanded Cabrini, more than tripling the size of the original public housing development. To create parkland for the Cabrini complex, the city began leasing a parcel of nearby land from the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago in 1948. The new park soon included a shelter house and sand box, as well as a playfield that could be flooded for skating in winter. After assuming management of the park pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957, the Chicago Park District constructed volleyball and basketball courts, a recreation building, and a spray pool during the following decade. In 1977, the Park District formally acquired the property and an adjacent vacant lot from the Archdiocese, more than doubling the park's size. Game tables and a soft surface playground were added in subsequent years. Known for years as Hudson Park for adjacent Hudson Street, in April\u00a01979, the park was renamed in honor of John R. Durso, a neighborhood resident with a long history of service to the community. Durso demonstrated an ongoing interest in the needs of the area's underprivileged children, sponsoring various activities including the local scouting program. Needy neighborhood families also benefited from his generosity during the Christmas season. "

  "history": "Currently under development near the mouth of the Chicago River and the shore of Lake Michigan, DuSable Park honors Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable (ca. 1745-1818), the first non-Native American settler at Chicago. A Haitian of French and African descent, DuSable traveled to New Orleans in 1764. The following year he journeyed up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, where he began to trade with the local Indians and married a young Potawatomi woman. As early as 1772, DuSable moved on to Chicago, establishing a remote trading post near what is now Pioneer Court, just north of the river. DuSable's world began to change after the Revolutionary War, when the American government claimed the Great Lakes region as its own, and settlers began arriving from the east. In 1800, DuSable sold his property at Chicago and went south to Peoria. Two centuries after DuSable's departure, Chicago is an unimaginably different place, home to nearly three million residents, with skyscrapers lining the Chicago River and the lakefront. In the mid-1980s, developers began to improve 60 acres of under-utilized industrial land north of the river with residences and commercial structures. To provide parkland for the new City Center, the Chicago Dock and Canal Trust donated more than three acres of property east of Lake Shore Drive to the Chicago Park District in 1988.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired property from the City of Chicago for the park in 2007.

  "history": "In 1907, during an era of major political reform, the West Park Commission acquired land and began creating its first three neighborhood parks, Dvorak, Eckhart, and Stanford Parks. These were inspired by a revolutionary system of parks that opened in 1905 to provide breathing space and social services to overcrowded immigrant neighborhoods on Chicago's south side. The need for such facilities was even greater on the west side. Because of this population density, the commissioners could only acquire small pieces of property. Dvorak Park was originally only 3.85 acres in size. In recognition of the area's large Bohemian population, the West Park Commission named the park for Anton Dvorak (1841-1904), the famous Czech composer. Jens Jensen, then the West Park Commission's general superintendent and chief landscape designer, developed the original plan for Dvorak Park. Jensen included all of the major components introduced in the south side neighborhood parks: swimming and wading pools, changing rooms and shower baths, an athletic field, a playground, outdoor gymnasiums, and a fieldhouse. Unlike the south side parks, Jensen's neighborhood parks included children's gardens and Prairie-style architecture. Dvorak Park's fieldhouse and bathhouse were designed by William Carbys Zimmerman, who then served as State Architect. In 1998, the Chicago Park District expanded the park by acquiring an adjacent parcel of land. The expansion includes a new walkway and soccer fields. "

  "history": "Soon after World War II, the Chicago Park District began a major initiative to create new parks for the first time in many years. This Ten Year Plan identified 43 sites in neighborhoods with few recreational facilities and in undeveloped areas which were starting to boom. Estimating that a total of $60 million dollars would be needed for the ten-year effort, the Park District began selling $24 million dollars of new bonds in 1945 to pay for the initial phase of the project. Among the first properties acquired was the 3.5-acre site for Eckersall Park. \u00a0The Chicago Park District acquired property for the park from 1946-1955 through land acquisition and vacating streets and alleys.\u00a0 The property remained unimproved for several years. Finally in 1956, the Park District planted the landscape, created two playground areas divided by South Philips Avenue, and transformed the bisecting street into basketball courts and a vehicle turn-around. The park's name honors Walter Herbert Eckersall (1884--1930) an All-American football player from Chicago. Having played football as a student at Hyde Park High School between 1899 and 1902, Eckersall was pursued by several colleges with winning teams. He decided on the University of Chicago, and went on to set every punting and kicking record between 1903 and 1906. After college, Eckersall became a noted sports critic for the Chicago Tribune. While writing for the newspaper, Eckersall was instrumental in creating the Golden Gloves and Silver Skates competitions. "

Two years earlier, a revolutionary system of ten neighborhood parks had opened on the city\u2019s South Side. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers and D.H. Burnham & Co., these innovative parks not only provided landscape amenities, but also public bathing, branches of the Chicago Public Library, classes and vocational training, inexpensive hot meals, health care, and a variety of recreational programs. Eckhart Park was among the first in a system of small West Side parks authorized by state legislation in 1905. The park takes its name from Bernard A. Eckhart (1852-1931), who played a prominent role in the neighborhood parks movement. Eckhart, president of the West Park Commission from 1905 through 1908, hired landscape architect Jens Jensen as General Superintendent for the West Park System. Jensen went on to become known as the Dean of the Prairie style of landscape architecture. In 1907, Jensen began designing Eckhart Park as one of the first three small parks planned by the West Chicago Park Commissioners to provide breathing space and social services for the congested tenement districts within their jurisdiction. Eckhart Park\u2019s 8-acre site presented Jensen with a major challenge. His initial plan of 1907 illustrates that he began with a rigid and formal layout in order to incorporate all of the ambitious program components. He later modified the plan to provide a looser organization of space, with activities integrated throughout. Eckhart Park\u2019s final plan included a playground, open-air gymnasiums, a swimming Pool with a Prairie style bridge separating the deep and shallow ends, and community gardens where children could learn to plant and tend their plots. It also included a handsome brick field house and natatorium designed by William Carbys Zimmerman who then served as the State Architect for Illinois.

  "history": "Edison Park takes its name from the surrounding Edison Park community, named in 1892 for American inventor Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). The area's first settler, Rev. Christian Ebinger (1812-1879), Sr., headed west from Detroit with his family in 1833. When their horse fell dead from a rattle snake bite 15 miles northwest of Chicago, the Ebingers decided to settle on the spot. In 1907, the Village of Edison Park built a new public school, naming it for Christian Ebinger. After Chicago annexed Edison Park in 1910, Ebinger School came under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Board of Education. The financial pressures of the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of Chicago's 22 independent park boards into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Two years later in 1936, the Park District began leasing Ebinger School and its site from the Board of Education. Though the Park District inherited more than 100 parks from the 22 independent boards, the Ebinger School property was the first park to be developed by the new agency. Renaming the property Edison Park in 1937, the Park District began rehabilitating the school building and its grounds to provide fieldhouse facilities and an attractive surrounding greenspace. \u00a0The Chicago Park District acquired the property from the Chicago Board of Education in 1986.\u00a0 The fieldhouse soon offered a library; game and club rooms; and spaces for wood working, weaving, and other crafts.

Ellis purchased more than 135 acres of South Side lakefront property. He owned and ran the Ellis Inn, farmed the land, and served as the area\u2019s milkman. In 1855, Ellis subdivided his land holdings between 31st and 39th Streets, from Lake Michigan to South Park Boulevard (now Martin Luther King Drive), and donated a wedge-shaped parcel to the city for use as a public park. The area surrounding Ellis Park, known as the Oakland community, had first developed as a fashionable neighborhood, fell into decline at the turn of the twentieth century. At that time, as wealthy residents move out, their homes were divided into apartments and rooming houses. Ellis Park had also been impacted. Its landscape was carved up by adjacent residents who extended sidewalks from their homes and planted trees and shrubs on either side. A decaying bandstand added to the sense of disorder. In the early 1900s, the Special Park Commission reclaimed Ellis Park from the encroaching property owners. Acclaimed landscape architect Jens Jensen (1860- 1951), then serving as a Special Park Commission member, redesigned the 3-acre park. His 1906 plan included two ornamental fountains and a circular, tree-edged lawn. Decades later, the surrounding neighborhood changed again, and the federal government erected the Ida B. Wells housing project. To accommodate the area\u2019s larger population, the city\u2019s Bureau of Parks and Recreation (successor to the Special Park Commission) installed two new wading pools which drew more than 14,000 children the first summer. The City of Chicago transferred Ellis Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 In 1962, the Park District purchased additional land east, west, and north of the original park from the City of Chicago, more than tripling its size. Improvements to the enlarged park included ball fields, tennis courts, as well as trees, lawns, and walkways. Over the years, the neighborhood surrounding Ellis Park continued to change. The Chicago Housing Authority demolished the Ida B. Wells and Madden Park Homes. Today, CHA provides a number of scattered site rental apartments in the neighborhood. For years, the community lacked swimming facilities and other amenities. In 2015, ground was broken in Ellis Park for a state-of-the-art field house providing the community with a greatly needed recreational and cultural facility. The Chicago Park District worked with the City of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Housing Authority and its partner The Community Builders, Inc. (TCB) to develop the new center. Designed by Booth Hansen and Nia Architects, the 32,000-square foot two story building reflects a contemporary aesthetic. Composed of precast concrete, metal framing and glass fiber reinforced concrete wall panels, the building provides an indoor swimming pool; full-sized gymnasium; multi-purpose club rooms for art, education, performance, meetings and exercise; a fitness center with weight and strength training equipment; second-level outdoor patio space with catering kitchen for park and special events and fully equipped and accessible men\u2019s, women\u2019s and family locker rooms. The facility was completed and opened to the public in the summer of 2016. "

Officially designated Elm Park in 1973, the site was one of a number of park properties named for trees and plants at this time. American elms, the largest and most important variety of elm in North America, have long held an important public role. They served as council trees for Native Americans before Europeans arrived. Around the time of the Revolutionary War, nearly every town had an American elm designated as a Liberty tree. Early in the 20th century, elms lined the streets of Chicago and towns and cities across the nation, creating lovely canopies for the roadways. Unfortunately, just before 1930, Dutch elm disease began to attack these large, elegant shade trees, disrupting their systems for conducting water. Many elms died, and boulevards and yards were stripped bare. Today, individual trees can be protected by injecting or spraying them with fungicide, but Dutch elm disease still spreads from tree to tree unless they are closely monitored. "

The park commission acquired a two-acre parcel from the Chicago Town and Tennis Club, adjacent to the Chicago Elk Club in 1920. Although the new park was quite small, it was improved as a lovely green space with a wading pool, a children's playground, tennis courts, gardens, and a comfort station.\u00a0 In 1934, Emmerson Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the Lincoln Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District.

  "history": "In the 1920s, as the Washington Heights community area was experiencing a building boom, the Fernwood Park District decided to create a new park before it was too late to acquire vacant land. Serving a neighborhood that was once the old Village of Fernwood, Fernwood Park District had formed in 1908. In 1925, after canvassing local property owners on the most desirable park location, the district acquired a 5-and-a-half acre site. Although there were limited funds for improving the property, the local community helped out. As ballfields were being laid out in 1926, the Fernwood Community Association donated lumber for the back-stop. \u00a0In 1929, the park was expanded after Fernwood Park District acquired more land.\u00a0 An area real estate office structure was moved into the new park for use as a small recreation building. Originally named Fernwood Commons, the site likely became known as Euclid Park to avoid confusion with nearby Fernwood and Fernwood Parkway Parks. Making reference to the ancient Greek mathematician who wrote the \"Elements,\" Euclid Park's name was derived from the surrounding subdivision, O'Dell's Addition to Euclid Park. In 1933, the City of Chicago acquired land to expand the park.\u00a0 In 1934, Euclid Park became part of the Chicago Park District when all 22 of the city's independent park commissions were consolidated into a single agency. After improving the park's landscape and adding tennis courts, the newly-formed park district began offering glass blowing, model airplane-making, and other crafts classes in Euclid Park's small building.\u00a0 From 1935 until 1970, the Chicago Park District vacated land for park expansion.\u00a0 In 1960, the park was fully rehabilitated and its original structure was replaced with a new fieldhouse.

In fact, some conifers lose their leaves in winter, and many tropical trees, including palms, are evergreens. Among the most fabled of the evergreens are the coastal and Sierra redwoods. The coastal redwood, which grows in the fog belt along the Pacific Coast from Southern Oregon to Central California, can grow to a towering height of 360 feet. The slightly shorter Sierra redwood or giant sequoia can live to be 3,000 years old. The Earth's largest living thing is a giant Sequoia known as General Sherman.

Many of these beaches were located in the Rogers Park neighborhood, where a growing population of apartment dwellers lacked easy access to recreational opportunities. In contrast to the City's larger municipal beaches, the street-end beaches, though manned by lifeguards, had no changing rooms or other facilities. Fargo Street and its namesake beach are named for James C. Fargo (1829--), an active north side real estate developer. Born in Watervale, New York, Fargo at 15 entered the business office of his brother, William G. Fargo, who ran an express-mail delivery service between Buffalo and Albany, New York, and another between Buffalo and Detroit, Michigan. James Fargo moved west to run the Wells & Co. office in Detroit in 1847. In 1855, Fargo came to the Chicago office of the reorganized firm, by then called the American Express Company. (In the meantime, William Fargo and his partner, Henry Wells, founded Wells, Fargo & Company to handle the banking and express needs of California Gold Rush entrepreneurs.)

  "history": "Fernwood Park takes its name from the surrounding area settled by Dutch farmers in the late 19th century. Prior to its annexation to Chicago in 1891, the Village of Fernwood created a pleasure drive between South 95th and 103rd Streets at South Eggleston Avenue. Known as Fernwood Parkway, for years this narrow strip was the neighborhood's only parkland. In the early 1900s, residents were impressed with the superb nearby parks created by the South Park Commission. Fernwood residents lobbied the commission to extend its boundaries into their neighborhood, but their effort failed. Finally, in 1908, the Fernwood and Washington Heights Improvement Association successfully petitioned the county to form the Fernwood Park District. The new park district acquired a 12-acre farm with orchards, barns, and outbuildings in 1908. John Algots, the City of Chicago's Superintendent of Parks, created a park plan, transforming the property into a landscape of lawn, trees, shrubs, and a wading pool. A house on the site was remodeled as a fieldhouse, and in 1912, a branch of the Chicago Public Library opened in one of its rooms. In 1919, the citizens of Fernwood donated a World War I veterans' monument. In 1926, the remaining park acreage was acquired and additional landscape improvements were made. In 1934, Fernwood Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the city's 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. A few years later, the newly-formed park district remodeled Fernwood Park's fieldhouse. Despite this, demands for additional interior space continued. In the mid-1980s, the original building was replaced with a modern fieldhouse, which received a natatorium and swimming pool addition in 1996. "

  "history": "In 1887, the newly formed Village of Fernwood created a wide green parkway between South 99th and 103rd Streets. Trees and lawn were soon planted, and the village extended Fernwood Parkway north to South 95th Street the following year. Though the new parkway provided a lovely setting for new homes and businesses, the sleepy village remained sparsely settled with only a railroad depot, a post office, and a few corner grocery stores. In 1889, many towns and villages outside of Chicago, including the communities on all four sides of Fernwood, voted for annexation to the city. Fernwood residents, however, feared that becoming part Chicago would result in saloons opening and taxes increasing, and thus voted against annexation. Due to its refusal to be annexed, the Village of Fernwood became an island in the city, nicknamed \"the Monaco of Chicago.\" Although the small village retained its independence, it could not afford to pave its streets or build a school. Residents soon began reconsidering their decision. In 1891, the village was annexed to Chicago, and the city assumed management of Fernwood Parkway. Early in the 20th century, the city's Special Park Commission improved Fernwood Parkway by planting additional trees and shrubs, installing a wading lagoon, and enclosing the park with iron fencing. By the late 1920s, the lagoon had been filled, and the parkway was under the management of the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation. The bureau continued maintaining the site until 1957, when more than 250 city-owned properties were transferred to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The district re-graded and re-planted Fernwood Parkway and installed new lighting in the 1960s and 1970s. "

  "history": "Eugene Field Park was created by the Albany Park District, an independent park board formed in 1917 to provide recreational facilities and enhance the Chicago River's banks in the rapidly-developing North Park and Albany Park communities. In 1923, the Albany Park District began purchasing nearly ten acres of riverside land in the center of its territory. Although land acquisition took a full decade, landscape architect Henry J. Stockman soon prepared a plan that took full advantage of the picturesque river bank site, and improvements began in 1925. In 1928, Clarence Hatzfeld, a member of the park board and architect of many northwest side recreational, commercial, and residential buildings, designed a Tudor Revival-style fieldhouse for the park. A stone grotto and fountain originally graced the front of the fieldhouse. Inside, a Federal Works Progress Administration artist created a mural entitled \"The Participation of Youth in the Realm of the Arts.\" \u00a0The Albany Park Commissioners acquired land for Field Park from 1923-1933.\u00a0 In 1934, the financial stresses of the Great Depression prompted consolidation of the city's 22 independent park boards, including the Albany Park District, into the unified Chicago Park District. By 1938, Eugene Field Park had a playground, a wading pool, tennis courts, and a lovely wooded picnic area. A decade later, the Park District expanded the site by more than two acres, improving the new property with baseball and football fields. In 1980, the Park District began leasing additional city land along the riverbank.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired more land through acquisition and vacating streets and land to expand Field Park from 1946-2015.\u00a0 Recent park improvements include a soft surface playground and ornamental fencing along Foster Avenue. The park honors writer and poet Eugene Field (1850-1895), a nationally-renowned children's author. Among Field's best known works are \"Little Boy Blue,\" \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod,\" and the \"Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat.\" Born in St. Louis, Field worked for a number of western and midwestern newspapers before being recruited by the Chicago Daily News to write a humor column in 1883. Field made his home on Chicago's north side. "

In 1873, some years after marrying a Madison attorney, James Monroe Flower, Lucy and her family moved to Chicago. She soon became active in charitable efforts. In 1880, Lucy helped to found the Illinois Training School for Nurses (later named the Cook County School of Nursing). At a time when County nursing positions were generally doled out through political patronage, the school sought to provide professional training for nurses, establish standards, and make nursing a respectable profession for women. Serving on the Chicago Board of Education from 1891 to 1894, Lucy Flower inspired progressive initiatives in the schools such as manual training and kindergartens, and providing bathing facilities for children who lived in the tenement districts. Lucy also championed compulsory school attendance, which became law in 1897. She led the movement to create a new type of court for children under the age of 16. The resulting bill, approved in 1899, established the Cook County Juvenile Court, the first of its kind in the world. Peoples Park is located approximately 2 \u00bd miles from Lucy Flower\u2019s home at 1920 W. Wellington Ave. "

  "history": "Forest Glen Park takes its name from that of the surrounding community, largely composed of land once belonging to Billy Caldwell, the half-Indian, half-English chief of the Pottowattomis. Nicknamed \"The Sauganash,\" meaning \"The Englishman,\" Caldwell sold most of his land to farmers when his tribe was removed from the area in 1836. Though the territory was annexed to Chicago in 1899, it remained sparsely settled until the mid-1920s, when modern real estate development began. New Forest Glen residents soon sought to form their own park district to provide recreational facilities in their developing community, thereby enhancing the area and raising property values. After successfully preventing annexation by the neighboring Jefferson Park District, Forest Glen residents voted to create the independent Forest Glen Park District in 1929. The new Park District created just one park. Early in 1933, the Forest Glen Park District purchased an irregularly-shaped, one-third-acre property soon known as Forest Glen Park. The Park District immediately installed beautiful plantings and equipped the site with playground equipment. The district also commissioned architects to develop fieldhouse plans and secured a construction loan from the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works. In mid-1934, the Great Depression forced consolidation of the 22 independent park boards into the Chicago Park District. The newly-formed Chicago Park District acquired the park as part of its portfolio and decided not to pursue the fieldhouse plan, instead maintaining Forest Glen Park as a playground and greenspace. "

  "history": "The Near West Side, one of Chicago's most fashionable neighborhoods in the mid-nineteenth century, had experienced significant decline by the Depression Era. Soon after the founding of the Chicago Housing Authority in 1937, it began replacing deteriorated buildings in the neighborhood with new multi-unit public housing developments. Built between 1938 and 1961, the area's four large housing complexes, known jointly as ABLA, include: the Jane Addams Houses, Robert H. Brooks Homes and Extension, Loomis Courts, and Grace Abbott Homes. In 1945, the City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation created Fosco Park on Board of Education property to serve the growing population. The two-acre park included a playing field and a small brick recreation building. The city named the park for Peter Fosco (1894--1975), president of the Laborer's International Union of North America and former Cook County Board commissioner. In 1959, the Chicago Park District assumed management of Fosco Park. The following year, the Park District also began leasing an adjoining 1/2-acre housing authority property which included the Robert H. Brooks Homes Community Center. The Board of Education transferred ownership of its two acres to the Park District in 1991.\u00a0 In 2010 and 2015, the Chicago Housing Authority transferred property to the Chicago Park District for the park. At the turn of the 21st century, Fosco Park and its surrounding neighborhood experienced significant changes. Some of the existing ABLA housing units were rehabilitated, while others were replaced with new low-rise residences. Fosco Park's small brick recreation building and the adjacent community center were razed and a new state-of-the-art facility was erected at 1312 S. Racine. The 80,000-square-foot Community Center opened in Summer 2005 and is jointly programmed by the Chicago Park District and Marcy Newberry Association. "

  "history": "Foster Park honors J. Frank Foster (1852-1926), long-time South Park System superintendent and a leader in park management throughout the United States. Having begun as engineer in the 1870s, Foster became superintendent in 1891 when the South Park Commission was preparing for the World's Columbian Exposition to open in Jackson Park two years later. Besides assisting with the fair and transforming its site back into parkland, Foster is credited with developing the nation's first neighborhood parks. Conceived as lovely green \"breathing spaces\" to provide recreation and social services in the city's most congested tenement districts, the first ten new south side parks opened in 1905. The revolutionary parks included the nation's first fieldhouses and offered public bathing; the city's earliest branch libraries; English lessons and other classes; inexpensive hot meals; health care; and a variety of recreational programs. Foster's concept was so successful that President Theodore Roosevelt declared it \"the most important civic achievement in any American city.\" Shortly after Foster's death in 1926, the South Park Commission decided to name one of its newest projects in his honor. Located in the growing Auburn Gresham community, the site was envisioned as an impressive 30-acre park with many of the features originated by Foster.\u00a0 Alleys and streets were vacated in 1890 for the park.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the commissioners had to make 50 separate land purchases between 1921-1932, and the park developed very slowly. By the early 1930s, Foster Park consisted only of an athletic field, tennis courts, and a comfort station. In 1934, the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the city's 22 individual park commissions. The newly-formed Chicago Park District acquired the park as part of its portfolio and improved Foster Park's landscape and constructed a small recreation building there. Over the years, demands for additional indoor facilities continued. In 1950 the park district constructed an attractive Art Moderne-style fieldhouse, which was designed by the prominent Chicago architectural firm Shaw, Metz & Dolio. "

  "history": "The West Park Commissioners acquired property in 1911 and 1915 for this park.\u00a0 In 1914, renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen presented a plan for Franklin Park that was considered a \"radical change\" from earlier neighborhood parks. An innovative system of south side parks had inspired the West Park Commission to begin creating its own neighborhood parks in 1907. The small sites and numerous space requirements limited Jensen's ability to incorporate naturalistic elements. After several years of experimentation, Jensen created Franklin Park, evocative of the native Illinois landscape, though only 8.5 acres in size. Minimizing the amount of space devoted to indoor facilities, Jensen included playing fields enclosed by native plantings, a bird garden, and a shady \"old folks corner.\" Irregularly-shaped pools with rocky ledges emulated country swimming holes. In the \"spirit of Indian lore,\" the park also had an area for a campfire on the player's green, an elevated \"clearing\" used for outdoor dramatics and small gatherings. Despite Jensen's intention to devote the park primarily to outdoor activities, there were increasing demands for additional indoor facilities. In 1926, the park's original fieldhouse was expanded to meet these needs, but demand continued to grow.\u00a0 When the 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934 to form the Chicago Park District, the park became part of the District\u2019s portfolio.\u00a0 Finally, in 1972, the Chicago Park District replaced the original building with a larger, modern fieldhouse. In addition, changing recreational needs unfortunately led to the demise of Franklin Park's historic landscape elements. The park honors inventor, author, and American patriot, Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790). Having begun his career as a printer, Franklin became editor and owner of the Philadelphia Gazette. After inventing the Franklin stove in 1744, he conducted the earliest studies identifying lightning as electricity, including the famous kite-flying experiment. As a member of the Continental Congress, Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence. Franklin served as Ambassador to France, and later as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. "

  "history": "Planned in 1903 as part of the South Park Commission's revolutionary neighborhood park system, Fuller Park did not open to the public until 1911. The first ten south side neighborhood parks: Armour, Cornell, Davis, Russell, and Mark White Squares, and Bessemer, Ogden, Sherman, Hamilton, and Palmer Parks, were completed in 1905. Nationally influential, they provided \"breathing spaces\" as well as social and recreational services to their congested neighborhoods. Community protests about the proposed location for Fuller Park delayed its development until a nearby site was selected in 1908. \u00a0The South Park Commissioners acquired property for the park from 1905-1908.\u00a0 The new site had some difficult conditions; however, landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers were able to make these problems into assets. For instance, unsightly raised train tracks were hidden by an attractive grandstand.\u00a0 The South Park Commissioners had alleys and streets vacated in 1910 to expand the park.\u00a0 The park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934. Fuller Park's delay gave architect Edward H. Bennett of D. H. Burnham and Co. an opportunity to refine design concepts. Unlike Bennett's earlier fieldhouses, the first of the building-type nationally, Fuller Park's facility consisted of a symmetrical complex of buildings flanking a central outdoor children's courtyard. Commissioner Judge John Barton Payne donated funds for murals in the fieldhouse assembly hall. Painted by renowned muralist John Warner Norton, the artworks feature scenes of Spanish and French Explorers. Fuller Park honors Melville W. Fuller (1833-1910), Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1888 until 1910. A leader of the Chicago Bar, Fuller served as counsel for the City of Chicago in riparian rights disputes related to the development of parkland on the lakefront. Fuller served as a South Park Commissioner from 1882 until 1887. "

  "history": "When prominent businessman, attorney, and South Park Commissioner George W. Gage (--1875) died in office in 1875, his fellow board members decided to name a newly-developing park in his honor. \u00a0The South Park Commissioners expanded the park from 1874-1930 through land acquisition and vacating streets and alleys.\u00a0 In 1874, the commission had begun acquiring land for an elegant green square at the intersection of Western Avenue and what is now known as Garfield Boulevard. This property occupied a prominent location at the turning-point of the South Park Commission's boulevard system. Despite this, little had been done to complete Gage Park by the late 1890s. Frustrated by the park's unfinished condition, surrounding residents repeatedly asked for improvements. Finally, in 1903, the commission added ball fields, tennis courts, a wading pool, and a beautiful sunken garden with a formal reflecting pool and colonnade. In 1918, several small land purchases were made to extend the park's southern boundary. The following year, the commission constructed a swimming pool, separate men's and women's outdoor gymnasiums, and a children's playground in this area. Although in 1905 the South Park Commission had pioneered the development of the nation's earliest fieldhouses, by the 1920s, Gage Park still did not have one. After receiving petitions from residents, the commissioners finally agreed to build a fieldhouse in Gage Park in 1926. The classical structure, designed by in-house architects, was constructed two years later, and jointly dedicated by the South Park Commissioners and the Gage Park Citizens Improvement Club. Within a few years, two murals adorned the building's interior. One of them, located in an office, portrays folkway traditions of local immigrants. The auditorium mural, painted by acclaimed artist Tom Lea in 1931, depicts explorers and pioneers looking westward as a heavenly figure in the clouds points the way.\u00a0 The park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934.

  "history": "Galewood Park serves the neighborhood known for many years by that name. The community was named for Abram Gale (1795-1889), whose land was subdivided in 1870 to form the suburb of Galewood. Having arrived from New York City in 1835, Gale purchased 320 acres in the Town of Jefferson in 1837, and began to build a house there. \"I brought all my household goods along,\" he said, \"and among them was a Chickering piano, the second ever made. It was the first and only one in the village for a good many years, and it was a great card for me. The Indians would walk around the house mysteriously whenever my daughter played on it, staring in wonderment at the strange sounds.\" Gale also said that when he arrived he was installed at once as a member of the fire company. He went on to say \"Every man was armed with two buckets, and we would all stand in a line with one end of the line at the lake and the other at the fire, and we would pass the buckets along.\" When one of his neighbors tried to take his land, Gale dug a ditch all around his claim. Gale's heavily-wooded property proved hard to plow. He eventually quit farming, and the hamlet of Galewood emerged there. The park's creation dates to the 1920s, when the North Austin Manor Neighborhood Club purchased the property and began developing a playground and ball fields there. In 1925, the neighborhood club petitioned the Northwest Park District, one of 22 park commissions later consolidated into the Chicago Park District, to take over the site. \u00a0From 1928-1929, the Northwest Park District purchased the parkland, along with adjoining property to expand the park. \u00a0The park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated in 1934.\u00a0 After the Chicago Park District took over, it installed recreational facilities including an ice-skating rink and a small fieldhouse.\u00a0 Streets and alleys were vacated in 1935 to expand the park.

  "history": "In 1869, the Illinois state legislature established the West Park Commission, which was responsible for three large parks and interlinking boulevards. \u00a0This park was first named Central Park in accordance with a resolution adopted by the West Park Commission in 1869.\u00a0 The West Park Commissioners acquired property for the park from 1870-1932.\u00a0 This was the park name until 1881, when the name was changed to \u201cGarfield Park\u201d to honor President James A. Garfield (1831- 1881) after his assassination in 1881. \u00a0Plans for Garfield, Humboldt, and Douglas Parks had been completed ten years earlier, by William Le Baron Jenney. Jenney is best known today as the \u201cfather of the skyscraper.\u201d\u00a0 His ambitious plans for these three large parks could not be realized all at once, Garfield Park was the earliest developed of these three great original West Side parks, it was developed in stages, beginning with the east lagoon.\u00a0 The lagoons and a unique suspension bridge designed by Jenney remain today.\u00a0 Garfield Park remains the best example of Jenney\u2019s landscape efforts in Chicago.\u00a0 Some notable components of the park were the first Refectory (Casino or Pavilion) Building that was completed and opened to the public in 1884. This was the first building of its kind in a park. In 1893, a Pagoda Building was erected, and the first stone bridge was constructed over the lagoon connection.\u00a0 In 1906, construction started for replacements for these buildings.\u00a0 A Lunch Room in the new Refectory Building opened to the public in 1908.\u00a0 Other recreational facilities were also constructed, roque courts, an eight hole golf course, and a bandstand that still exists today. Jens Jensen, a Danish immigrant who began working as a laborer for the West Park System in the 1880\u2019s, and after a decade, worked his way up to the position of Superintendent of Humboldt Park. At that time, the West Park System was entrenched in political graft. In 1900, the commissioners fired Jensen because of his efforts to fight the corruption. Five years later, during major political reforms, new commissioners appointed him General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect. Deteriorating and unfinished sections of the parks allowed Jensen to experiment with his evolving Prairie style. For instance, when he took over, each of the three parks had small, poorly maintained conservatories. Rather than repairing these structures, which each displayed similar collections, Jensen decided to replace them with a single centralized facility. Designed in conjunction with an engineering firm, Hitchings and Company, Jensen conceived the Garfield Park Conservatory as a work of landscape gardening under glass. This Conservatory replaced the one that was built in 1887.\u00a0 Jensen\u2019s Conservatory was considered revolutionary when it opened to the public in 1908, the form of the building emulated a \"great Midwestern haystack,\" while inside the rooms were wonderful compositions of water, rock, and plants.\u00a0 The first midwinter Flower Show in the City was held in December 1909 at the new Conservatory. In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed the \"Gold Dome Building\" in Garfield Park to provide a new administrative headquarters for the West Park Commission. Architects, Michaelsen and Rognstad, designed the structure.\u00a0 This firm designed other notable park buildings including the Humboldt, Douglas, and LaFolette Park Fieldhouses. With the Park Consolidation Act in 1934, Garfield Park became part of the Chicago Park District, when the City's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide agency. At that time, due to the Park District consolidation the administrative offices were no longer needed and the \"Gold Dome\" building became Garfield Park's fieldhouse. "

The park was originally named in honor of John McClaren (1836 -1916), a prominent Chicago businessman who served on the Board of Education. The site included a small fieldhouse, playground equipment, a basketball court, and a playing field that was flooded in winter for ice skating. By 1905, nearly 180,000 people used the park annually, and McClaren Playground teams competed in baseball, football, and basketball. In 1957, the City transferred McClaren Playground to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. Within a few years, the Park District demolished the fieldhouse, upgraded the playground, and re-planted the landscape. In 1979, the park was renamed in honor of Giuseppi Garibaldi (1807-1882), the Italian general known for the conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1860. (The City had recently vacated a nearby street named for Garibaldi.) Neighborhood residents, the park district, and the city's Department of Urban Renewal together arranged to move the statue of Garibaldi, which had been unveiled in Lincoln Park in 1901, to the recently-renamed Garibaldi Park. The monument was installed at its new location in 1982.\u00a0 In 1996, the City transferred more property to the Chicago Park District expanding the park. "

  "history": "In the years during and after World War II, the population of Gately Park's Pullman neighborhood increased by more than one third. Established in 1947 on former Pullman Car Company land, Gately Park was part of a ten-year Chicago Park District plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served Chicago neighborhoods. Park improvements began in 1950 and included a grandstand, locker rooms, and an office building. High school football teams from both the Chicago Public Schools and the Catholic League quickly put the new facilities to use. In 1953, the park was named for James H. Gately (1883-1972), a longtime businessman in the nearby Roseland community, and then President of the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners. (Gately himself voted against the name change, which broke with tradition by naming the park for a living person.) Appointed Commissioner in 1945, Gately was elected President of the Board in 1946, serving in that position until 1967. During his long tenure, the park district sold $79 million in park improvement bonds, increased the total number of parks from 135 to 430, and expanded overall park acreage to 6,800 acres. In 1959, Gately oversaw the transfer of more than 250 city-owned parks to the Chicago Park District. "

  "history": "Gill Park honors Lake View resident Joseph L. Gill (1886--1972), a Chicago Park District Commissioner, and local Democratic party leader. Gill served as 46th Ward Democratic Committeeman for more than 60 years. He was chairman of the Democratic County Central Committee from 1950 to 1953, and is said to have engineered Richard J. Daley's first nomination for mayor in 1955. Gill served the public in various capacities, including as controller of the Forest Preserve District beginning in 1919, as Illinois state representative from 1926 to 1930, and as clerk of the Municipal Court for most of the subsequent three decades. In 1960, Mayor Daley appointed Gill to the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners. Gill was serving as Park District vice president at the time of his death in 1972. Two years before, the Park District had decided to establish a recreational facility on West Sheridan Road in the densely-populated Lake View neighborhood.\u00a0 In 1970, the Chicago Park District acquired the site with the help of funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and plans had been developed for a multi-story fieldhouse with a swimming pool, a gymnasium, and an assembly hall. Neighbors refer to the impressive structure as the \"high-rise fieldhouse.\" The Park District installed a new soft surface playground at Gill Park in 1991. "

The gingko is a deciduous tree with unusual broad, fan-shaped, heavily-veined leaves that turn from pale green to bright yellow in the fall. Often called a living fossil, the gingko is the sole survivor of a primeval order of plants that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. Buddhist monks in ancient China apparently preserved the tree by cultivating it in their monastery gardens. Interestingly, the ancient tree has proved ideal for modern urban environments, tolerating the effects of pollution and poor-quality soil with relative ease. "

  "history": "Gompers Park was created by the Albany Park District, one of 22 independent park districts consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. In 1926, not long after the Albany Park District identified nearly 40 acres of wooded farmland along the North Branch of the Chicago River, landscape architect Henry J. Stockman prepared a plan to transform the property into parkland. Improvements began almost as soon as initial land purchases were completed in 1927.\u00a0 Albany Park District acquired more land for the park in 1928 and in 1931.\u00a0 By 1932, in addition to wooded areas and a natural stream dammed to create lagoons, the property had basketball courts, archery ranges, football fields, and playgrounds. Clarence Hatzfeld, a Chicago architect and member of the Albany Park board, designed the park's Tudor Revival-style fieldhouse. In 1934, financial pressures created by the Great Depression prompted formation of the Chicago Park District and the park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio. Using federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Park District soon began rehabilitating the southern portion of the park, constructing tennis courts, a footbridge over the river, a dam and spillway for the lower lagoon. After adding a wading pool in 1946, the park district built a full-sized swimming pool 30 years later.\u00a0 In 1950, the Chicago Park District acquired land to expand the park.\u00a0 In 1979, the Chicago Park District gave some of the park land to the City of Chicago.\u00a0 In the mid-1990s, with tremendous community support, the Park District began restoring the wetlands along the south bank of the river according to plans prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In its earliest days, Gompers Park was briefly known as Matson Park, for Samuel Matson, Superintendent of the Albany Park District. Albany Park District President Henry A. Schwartz, an official of the shoemakers' union, soon convinced the park board that it was inappropriate to name the park for a living person. In 1929, the District renamed the site in honor of Samuel Gompers (1850-1924), long-time president of the American Federation of Labor. Elected president of his local cigar makers' union in 1875, Gompers progressed quickly through the ranks, becoming the AFL's first president in 1886. During his 40-year tenure, AFL membership grew from 150,000 to 2,900,000, and the average wage for skilled labor increased by 250%. "

The Chicago Park District took jurisdiction in 1934, with the consolidation of the city's 22 independent park commissions. Though the park had never been formally renamed, it was by this time known as Goudy Park, in honor of William C. Goudy (1824-1893). Goudy, a highly-respected attorney, acted as counsel to the Lincoln Park Board and served as its president between 1887 and 1893. In 1877, Goudy went before the U.S. Supreme Court to argue the watershed Munn v. Illinois case, which established the authority of states to limit rates charged by private industries acting in the public interest. In 1991, the Chicago Park District created a custom-designed playground for Goudy Square Park. It includes ornamental metal fencing, period light fixtures, brick paths, and a limestone and bronze drinking fountain with a turtle, frog and fish produced by Walter Arnold. "

  "history": "Grand Crossing Park and its surrounding community take their name from a historic train wreck, which occurred less than a mile away from the site of the park. In the early 1850s, a number of railroad lines linking southern states to downtown Chicago began extending through the neighborhood. In 1853, a terrible collision between Illinois Central and Michigan Southern Railroad trains resulted in 18 deaths and 40 injuries. Public officials responded by forcing all trains to come to a complete stop at 75th Street and South Chicago Avenue, the site of the accident. Although signal lights were installed, the intersection remained dangerous until the tracks were finally elevated in 1912. Because of the extensive railroad service, the area developed early. By the 1880s, Greater Grand Crossing included numerous factories and workers' homes. The neighborhood was annexed to Chicago in 1889. The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in nearby Jackson Park spurred further growth. By 1907, the South Park Commission began efforts to create a park for the expanding population. Bolstered by the recent success of its ten revolutionary parks, the South Park Commissioners wanted to provide similar facilities for Grand Crossing, including a playground, a playing field, wading and swimming pools, and a fieldhouse. After acquiring 17 acres of land between 1908 and 1910, the South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers, landscape designers of the previous neighborhood parks, to lay out Grand Crossing and three other new parks. In-house South Park Commission designers modified the Olmsteds' proposals to create a single plan for both Grand Crossing and Trumbull Parks. The plans differed only in that their orientation was reversed. The two parks also have identical classically designed fieldhouses, constructed in 1914.\u00a0 Since 1934, Grand Crossing Park has been part of the Chicago Park District when the 22 park districts consolidated.\u00a0 In 2010, streets and alleys were vacated for park expansion.

Following its practice of the time, the bureau named the playlot for the adjacent street, Grand Avenue. Originally known as Whisky Point Road, the street's more elegant name may have been borrowed from Colonel Thomas Jefferson Vance Owens (1801-1835), an early Chicago Indian Agent. Owens, elected the first president of the Town of Chicago in 1833, once proclaimed Chicago \"a grand place to live.\" In 1957, the City transferred Grand Park, along with more than 250 other properties to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. Several years later, the Park District removed the spray pool and rehabilitated the park site. Further improvements came in 1991, with the installation of a new soft surface playground. "

Grant, Grant Park was developed as one of Chicago's first parks and expanded through land reclamation. The park was the focus of several disputes in the late 1800s and early 1900s over open space use. It is bordered on the north by Randolph Street, on the south by Roosevelt Road, on the west by Michigan Avenue and on the east by Lake Michigan.

The Field House in Maggie Daley Park is the central hub for indoor and outdoor programming throughout the seasons. Traditional Chicago Park District programming such as Day Camps is offered, as well as specialized activities that utilize the new park features, including the climbing park and skating ribbon. Some rental spaces are available in the field house for special events. Buckingham Fountain The center piece of Grant Park is Buckingham Fountain, one of the world's largest fountains.

The Museum Campus is the site of three of the city's most notable museums, all dedicated to the natural sciences: Adler Planetarium, Field Museum of Natural History, and Shedd Aquarium. A narrow isthmus along Solidarity Drive, dominated by Neoclassical sculptures of Kosciuszko, Havlicek and Copernicus, connects to Northerly Island where the planetarium is located. Art Institute of Chicago Built in 1893 and sitting on the western edge of Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago is one of the premier art museums and art schools in the United States. The Institute is known especially for the extensive collection of Impressionist and American art, such as \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" and \"American Gothic.\" Hutchinson Field Much of the southern end of Grant Park is given over to Hutchinson Field, an open space for large events and a dozen baseball or softball diamonds.

",
  "history": "Grant Park's beginnings date to 1835, when foresighted citizens, fearing commercial lakefront development, lobbied to protect the open space. As a result, the park's original area east of Michigan Avenue was designated \"public ground forever to remain vacant of buildings.\" Officially named Lake Park in 1847, the site soon suffered from lakefront erosion. The Illinois Central Railroad agreed to build a breakwater to protect the area in exchange for permission for an offshore train trestle. After the Great Fire of 1871, the area between the shore and trestle became a dump site for piles of charred rubble, the first of many landfill additions. In 1901, the city transferred the park to the South Park Commission, which named it for Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885), 18th President of the United States. Renowned architect Daniel H. Burnham envisioned Grant Park as a formal landscape with museums and civic buildings. However, construction was stalled by lawsuits launched by mail-order magnate Aaron Montgomery Ward, who sought to protect the park's open character. Finally, in 1911, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Ward's favor. New landfill at the park's southern border allowed construction of the Field Museum to begin, and the park evolved slowly. In 1934, the South Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District, which completed improvements using federal relief funds. At the turn of the 21st century, the north end of Grant Park underwent a multi-million-dollar facelift, and what was once old railbeds\u00a0were transformed into Millennium Park, a major landscape and festival site.\" "

  "history": "Graver Park was created by the Ridge Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Between 1920 and 1930, the population of the Ridge Park District's fashionable Beverly neighborhood increased by nearly 80%. To meet the recreational needs of those living in the southeast corner of its territory, the Ridge Park District began to purchase land there in 1928 and continued until 1931 when streets and alleys were vacated for park expansion. \u00a0After the Chicago Park District acquired the park in 1934 when the 22 park districts were consolidated, it added many outdoor athletic facilities. Though land acquisition continued through 1935, the district almost immediately decided to build a fieldhouse in the new park. Designed by Hetherington & Sons, Architects, and completed in 1929, the yellow brick fieldhouse had an assembly hall, three small club rooms, and two banquet halls. The following year, the Beverly-based Hetherington firm designed a shelter house and laid out a landscape plan for the park. The most recent improvement is an interactive waterplay area, constructed in 1998 when the Chicago Park District acquired more land for park expansion. Though the 1929 park dedication program referred to the site as \"Geringer Park,\" this never became its official name. At a park board meeting the following month, only Board President John Geringer voted in favor of that name. The park was variously known as Church Street Park (for an adjacent street) and Park No. 179 until the early 1950s, when the Chicago Park District designated the site Graver Park. The name honors Beverly resident and Chicago Park Commissioner Philip S. Graver (1878-1945). An official of the Graver Corporation, a producer of steel plate, Graver served on the South Park Board between 1928 and 1934. He was named commissioner of the Chicago Park District in 1936, and served as its vice president from 1937 until his death in 1945. "

  "history": "Located on land once owned by Billy Caldwell, an early Chicagoan of Irish and Native American blood, Edgebrook Park, as it was previously known, takes its name from the surrounding Edgebrook Manor subdivision, created in 1922. Seven years later in 1930, the developers donated a triangle of land along the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad tracks to the City of Chicago for use as parkland. By the close of World War II, the City had expanded the park, then known as Edgebrook Manor Triangle, into the right-of-way of adjacent Kinzua Avenue by vacating Kinzua Avenue in 1933, adding a tennis court. In the early 1950s, the City\u2019s Bureau of Parks and Recreation removed the tennis court and installed a basketball court and playground equipment. The City transferred Edgebrook Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957, along with more than 250 other properties pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. \u00a0In 1964, the park was expanded through land acquisition.\u00a0 The Park District rehabilitated the playground in 1965, and again in 1990. In the mid-1990s, a library was proposed at Edgebrook Park.\u00a0 In response, local resident and environmentalist Jeffrey S. Green (1938-1999) successfully prevented the potential loss of parkland by finding another location for the community library. In 2000, the Park District recognized Green's efforts by naming the park in his honor. Green also left his mark on the city as a whole. A life-long environmental activist, Green was a founder and president of Friends of the Chicago River, an organization whose goal is to revitalize the river. He was also a board member of Friends of the Parks for over six years and served as the organization's president. As a leader of both groups, Green worked diligently to improve Chicago's parks. "

  "history": "Chicago's West Ridge community grew significantly between 1920 and 1930, its population increasing from 7,500 to nearly 40,000 during that decade. In 1925, the River Park District purchased a 3.3-acre tract of land in the Green Briar subdivision of the West Ridge community - the northernmost section of that park district's territory. The following year, landscape architect and River Park District board member Jacob L. Crane, Jr. developed a plan for the rectangular park. The plan was featured as a model of good recreational design in Parks: A Manual of Municipal and County Parks. Lack of funds delayed park improvement until 1928, however, when the Chicago Landscape Company implemented a modified version of Crane's plan. That same year, the park district erected an elegant, 2-story, tile-roofed brick fieldhouse with a 300-seat assembly hall designed by Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld. Hatzfeld designed a number of notable buildings in Chicago's parks, including revival-style fieldhouses in Indian Boundary, Portage, and Independence Parks. In 1934, the River Park District and Chicago's 21 other independent park boards were consolidated into the newly-created Chicago Park District. Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Park District constructed a wading pool and tennis courts at Green Briar Park. A new soft surface playground was added in 1991. "

  "history": "In 2015, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners renamed Jarvis Beach Park in honor of Marion Mahony Griffin, an internationally significant architect who, until recently, had been largely forgotten.\u00a0 In 1917, the North Shore Park District acquired property for the park.\u00a0 The \u00bd-acre site was one of two dozen street end beaches that were operated by the city\u2019s Bureau of Parks and Recreation in the 1920s. Although lifeguards manned these small municipal beaches, they had no changing rooms or other facilities. In the early twentieth century, the small beaches were especially important because they provided open space and lake access to Rogers Park\u2019s growing population.\u00a0 In 1934, the park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated.\u00a0 In 1960, the City of Chicago acquired property for the park and transferred the property to the Chicago Park District pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957. Like other street-end beaches, Jarvis Beach Park had taken its name from the adjacent street. In this case, the roadway honors R.J. Jarvis. Chicago\u2019s City Council renamed a street previously called Bryan Avenue in 1913. Despite the renaming, little is known about R.J. Jarvis. The New York Times described Marion Mahony Griffin (1871\u20131961) as \u201cHeroine of Chicago Architecture.\u201d Born in Chicago and raised in Winnetka, Illinois, Marion Mahony received a degree in architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1894 and began her career in office of her cousin, Prairie School architect Dwight Heald Perkins. The following year, Marion found employment with Frank Lloyd Wright and soon played an important role in his office. She helped design of some of Wright\u2019s most significant commissions and produced exquisite drawings of his work that wove architecture and nature together in a unique way. When Wright abruptly abandoned his studio in 1909, Marion Mahony completed several of his unfinished architectural commissions. Marion married Walter Burley Griffin, another successful Prairie School architect, in 1911. Marion and Walter began practicing together, and soon entered a competition to design Australia\u2019s new capital, Canberra. Marion Mahony Griffin produced extraordinary renderings for their submission. The couple won first prize and moved to Australia in 1914 where they helped oversee the execution of the Canberra Plan and also received many other commissions to design architecture throughout the country. In the late 1930s, the Griffins moved to India and continued practicing architecture together. When Walter Burley Griffin died suddenly in 1937, Marion returned briefly to Australia, but then decided to come home to Chicago. She lived on W. Estes Avenue for the remainder of her life. During these years, Marion Mahony Griffin continued practicing architecture and also wrote a beautifully illustrated memoir entitled \u201cMagic of America.\u201d Among extant examples of Marion Mahony Griffin\u2019s work in Chicago is a two-panel mural in Armstrong School, a public elementary school in the West Rogers Park community.

  "history": "The Lincoln Park Commission acquired land and created Hamlin Park in 1909. Although the park commission had been established in 1869 to improve and manage Lincoln Park, in the early 1900s administrators began creating new parks and playgrounds in congested neighborhoods within their jurisdiction.

  "history": "The population of Chicago's South Side Washington Park community increased by 29% during the Depression and World War II. Many of the new arrivals were African-Americans from the rural south. Others moved to Washington Park from the nearby Grand Boulevard neighborhood, Chicago's original Black Belt. During the mid-1950s, the City purchased a quarter-acre property to provide additional recreational space for the growing community. The City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation soon installed playground equipment and a basketball court. The City of Chicago transferred this site, originally known as Indiana & 56th Park, to the Chicago Park District in 1957, along with more than 250 other properties pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. Due to neighborhood population decline and the park's proximity to Washington Park, the Chicago Park District periodically considered selling off the small playlot. The agency eventually decided to keep the site and improve it, removing the basketball court, planting new trees, and rehabilitating the playground in the mid-1990s. \u00a0In 2012, the Chicago Park District acquired land from the City to expand the park. As part of an initiative to recognize the contributions of Chicago women, the Park District renamed the site in honor of Lorraine Hansberry in 2004. Hansberry (1930 \u2013 1965) was an important African American playwright. She was born on the south side of Chicago and educated at Engelwood High School, where she became president of the debating club in 1947. During her early childhood, Lorraine\u2019s father challenged housing restrictions by purchasing a home in an all-white neighborhood and participating in a lawsuit against housing restrictions. The family suffered discrimination and racial violence, a theme that later influenced her work. Lorraine attended the University of Wisconsin, the Art Institute of Chicago, Roosevelt University and also pursued studies in Mexico. In 1950, she moved to New York and became a reporter for Paul Robeson\u2019s periodical, known as Freedom. In 1956, she wrote A Raisin in the Sun, which won the New York Drama Critics\u2019 Circle Award for Best Play of the Year in 1959.

  "history": "The City of Chicago acquired property and created George F. Harding Park to provide playground facilities to the rapidly changing Grand Boulevard neighborhood in 1928. Prominent early settlers established this lovely area of mansions and fine single-family houses in the 1860s and 1870s. By the turn of the century, many wealthy German-Jewish families had begun moving into the neighborhood. Around World War I, during the \"Great Migration,\" more than 50,000 African-Americans from the rural south moved to Chicago to find greater economic opportunities. Many of these new Chicagoans settled in Grand Boulevard. By 1925, this area had become the center of \"Bronzeville,\" a thriving, culturally-rich neighborhood of black-owned homes and businesses. In 1928, when George F. Harding Park opened to the public, it included playground equipment, separate playfields for boys and girls, and a small brick fieldhouse. The site remained a city park until 1957, when it was transferred to the Chicago Park District along with approximately 250 other properties pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The park received a major playlot renovation in 1988, and in 1995, the park district demolished the site's small brick fieldhouse. This small park honors George F. Harding (1868-1939), who served as alderman of the 27th Ward from 1905 to 1915, and later as a state senator and county treasurer. An avid collector of art, armor, and weapons, Harding built a castle-like museum on his property at 49th and Lake Park Avenue. Between the 1964 demolition of his museum and 1981, the collection was displayed in Chicago's Crerar Library. In 1982, after the library was razed, the Art Institute of Chicago received the George F. Harding collection. This was one of the largest gifts in the museum's history. "

  "history": "The West Park Commission created Harrison Park in 1912 to provide breathing space and social services to the overcrowded and industrialized lower west side.\u00a0 The West Park Commission acquired the majority of the property for the park in 1912 along with a portion of land in 1913.\u00a0 The commission's first three neighborhood parks, Dvorak, Eckhart, and Stanford Parks, were so successful that the State passed a bill permitting additional neighborhood parks in 1909. (Stanford Park no longer exists.) The Special Park Commission identified several potential park sites, including an eight-acre parcel previously used for lime production. The West Park Commission acquired the lime kiln site and renowned landscape designer Jens Jensen created the park's original plan. Swimming and wading pools and a natatorium building were constructed in 1914. Within the next several years, other recreational features including children's gardens were added, however, the park did not have a fieldhouse until 1928.\u00a0 In 1934, the park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District expanded the park in 1946 and 1949.\u00a0 In 1950, the Chicago Park District expanded the intensively-used small park by acquiring a stone quarry at its western boundary. During the following years, the neighborhood's Latino population grew, and in 1987, the natatorium was converted to the National Museum of Mexican Art. In 1993, a new state-of-the-art fieldhouse replaced the original facility. The park honors one of Chicago's most popular mayors, Carter H. Harrison, Sr. (1825-1893). A native Kentuckian who settled near Union Park, Harrison served as mayor for five terms between 1879 and 1893. He was assassinated by a disappointed office seeker late on the day of October 28, 1893. Ironically, the day had been designated Mayor's Day in Harrison's honor because it marked the closing of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago's first world's fair. There is a monument to Harrison in Union Park. "

Harsh received a degree from Simmons College Library School in Boston and in 1924, she was the first African American ever appointed as the head librarian for a branch of the Chicago Public Library. Many prominent African Americans believed that blacks on Chicago\u2019s south side were underserved by the library system, and in the 1920s, a movement was underway to open a full-service branch in Bronzeville. Philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, who agreed to help finance the new library, awarded Harsh a traveling scholarship that allowed her to visit African American collections in other cities. The branch opened in 1932. It was named for Dr. George Cleveland Hall, Chief of Staff at Provident Hospital, who had served on the Chicago Public Library board of directors and pushed for the south side branch library to be built. Harsh continued to work for the Chicago Public Library for more than twenty-five years. This park is less than a mile from Harsh\u2019s childhood home was located at 536 E. 44th Street. "

The City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation was operating 27 such beaches by 1937; some were in existence as early as 1921. Although lifeguards manned these small municipal beaches, they had no changing rooms or other facilities. In Rogers Park, the beaches met the summertime recreational needs of the many residents who lived in the attractive brick apartment buildings built in the eastern portion of the community between 1900 and 1930. The park site was long known as Albion Beach and Park for its location on Albion Street, where, atypically for Rogers Park, single-family residences lined the block approaching the lakeshore. In September 1960, the city council adopted a resolution requesting that the Park District rename Albion Park in honor of 49th Ward Alderman David L. Hartigan (1906-1959), who had recently died. A graduate of St. Ignatius and Northwestern Law School, Hartigan was an attorney in the City Treasurer's Office between 1943 and 1954, and served briefly as City Treasurer. After being elected alderman in 1955, Hartigan sat on the Committee on Forestry and Recreation, and was very active in creating additional parks and recreational space.

  "history": "At the close of World War II, the Chicago Park District adopted a ten-year plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served Chicago neighborhoods. The southwest side Ashburn neighborhood had remained sparsely settled as late as 1940, but its population began to surge immediately after the war. In 1946, the Park District selected a 20-acre park site at 83rd and South Richmond. Though land acquisition was completed before the end of 1948, park development did not begin for a number of years. In 1956, the Park District sold several acres at the north end of the Ashburn Park site to the Board of Education for a much-needed elementary school. Park improvements began at about the same time, and the new Ashburn Park with its winding walkways, ballfields, and small recreational building opened to the public in 1957. For twenty years, the park district and the Board of Education jointly operated Ashburn Park and Carroll Elementary School, offering recreational programming at both. In the mid-1970s, the Park District and the Board of Education terminated their joint venture, and the Park District built a new brick fieldhouse. At the same time, the park was renamed in honor of respected local figure Father Francis D. Hayes (1903--1976). Ordained as a Catholic priest in 1927, Fr. Hayes came to the \"wide open spaces\" of Ashburn in 1946 to found a parish there. Under Hayes' leadership, the St. Thomas More Parish grew with the Ashburn community. Hayes retired in 1972, but was still serving as St. Thomas More's pastor emeritus at the time of his death in 1976. "

Additionally, forty percent of Illinois endangered plants can be found in parks, preserves and open land within Calumet. The area holds great potential to become a regionally and nationally recognized place for wildlife habitat restoration and wildlife conservation. Its grand open spaces and historic wetlands are also promising for the development of land and water trails unparalleled in an urban setting. \u00a0These elements together form the basis for creating the Calumet Open Space Reserve, a plan bringing together state and local agencies to protect and enhance 3,900 acres of important wetland, forest and prairie habitat. An emphasis of the Reserve is connectivity \u2013 both in the form of trails for human use, and greenway corridors allowing wildlife to safely cross wider swaths of land without the risks posed by roadways and industrial plants. The Chicago Park District owns and manages over 800 of these acres while the remaining land is split between the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.\u00a0 Hegewisch Marsh Park is 132.95 acres.  Calumet features not only the Chicago Park District\u2019s largest landholdings, but some of its most impressive displays of biodiversity. Habitat variety spans marshes, prairies and woodlands that are host to over 200 species of birds, 20 species of fish, and rare mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Currently the Park District is working alongside sustainable development and conservation experts in addition to community members and other landholders in the region. The Calumet vision is to increase local recreation opportunities while connecting the region to the larger natural landscape to the north, south and west. Community economic development projects are also a priority of the Park District. Perpetuating the Calumet region\u2019s legacy as a hub of production in line with societal needs through contributing to the renewable energy sector and other sustainable businesses is a focus for the present and years to come.  ",
  "history": "Where now exists industrial plants and retired landfills once laid a vast network of rivers and swales meandering between marshes, lakes and seasonal ponds. (The word \u201ccalumet\u201d is believed to have come from a Potawatomi word for \u201clow body of deep, still water\u201d). Low ridges accommodated drier prairies, but most of the area was flat and grassy at the time of Joliet and Marquette\u2019s expedition through the region in the late 1600s. As predicted by prominent planners in the area such as Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett, Calumet in the post-Civil War era became a national epicenter for manufacturing \u2013 most notably of steel. The vast landscape surrounding the inland Lake Calumet (at that time almost twice its current size and no more than six feet deep at its lowest point) contained all of the elements necessary to become a tremendous hub of production: fresh water for cooling during the manufacturing process, plentiful cheap land, and numerous waterways to connect producers to growing markets. Starting as early as the 1860s, coal from southern Illinois was shipped in large quantities north to Chicago, soon met by iron ore shipped south down the great lakes from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. The first mill in the region was John Brown\u2019s Iron and Steel Mill at 119th Street, and it was followed by many to come. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, completed in 1848, served as the first direct connection between the Great Lakes and international waters through the Gulf of Mexico, precipitating a huge boom in business and population. At its height, the steel industry employed over 200,000 people who moved from across the country and the world to work in the plants. (Even today, with steel production falling by 30 to 40 percent, the amount of steel produced in southeast Chicago and northwest Indiana greatly overshadows any other steel producing region in the nation). The steel that built the Chicago skyline also drove the construction of the railroad, further raising the area\u2019s status as a shipping capital. In fact, as of a 2001 city report, Chicago was the United States\u2019 largest center for intermodal freight shipping \u2013 over 9 million containers are shipped in and out of Calumet annually, twice the amount of any other metropolitan region in the country, and third only to Hong Kong and Singapore. By the 1970s, the demand for steel began to drop as massive urban building and infrastructural projects were largely completed, and aluminum and plastic began to replace steel in popular products such as cans and auto interiors. By 1982, the steel industry in Chicago was only a skeleton of what it once was, and thousands of people lost their jobs. This industry crash affected workers in diverse sectors that either relied on the steel plants for business or served the employees of the steel plants and their families. Aside from mills and processing plants, stores, restaurants and country clubs all went out of business, leaving vacant lots, industrial grounds and many open spaces that remain today. While its industrial roots are important in understanding the current state of the Calumet region, it is also important to recognize the area\u2019s rich cultural and natural history. \u00a0Throughout the 19th century, Calumet remained so sparsely populated that it maintained a reputation for excellent hunting, fishing and recreation. Many local residents practiced subsistence hunting, while businessmen took a one-hour train ride from downtown Chicago to hunt at private hunting reserves. While several of these reserves, such as Woodman\u2019s Tavern and Douglas\u2019s Duck Pond have since been taken over by industry (the Acme Coke plant in South Deering), others like the Southeast Sportsmen\u2019s Club in Hegewisch remain today. Chicagoans from the North Side often vacationed in Calumet, spending the summer at the many hotels or summer homes established around Lake Calumet, which hosted sailing and crew regattas in the summer as well as skating and ice sailing on the lake in the winter. Local and statewide efforts to identify and protect Calumet\u2019s natural resources have been in motion since the later part of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) determined a plot of 3,000 acres to be a natural area of statewide significance. In 1998 the City of Chicago, Chicago Park District and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County adopted City Space: An Open Space Plan for Chicago. As a result of this project, Lake Calumet was identified as the most important wetland and natural area within the city and in urgent need of protection. The Calumet area has attracted federal interest as well, starting with $200,000 given to several local partners by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1999 to develop a sustainable land use plan for nature and industry. In the acquisition and restoration of land, the Chicago Park District and its partners have acquired grants from federal and state agencies as well as private business fulfilling mitigation requirements.\u00a0 The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) acquired land from the City of Chicago in 2003.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District entered into a lease agreement with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District for use of park property in 2012.\u00a0 The City of Chicago acquired land from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) in 2013.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired property for this park in 2011 and 2013 from the City of Chicago to expand the park.

  "history": "Hermosa Park takes its name from that of the surrounding neighborhood, originally known as Garfield's subdivision, and redesignated Hermosa in 1889 at the request of the City of Chicago. The park was created by the Northwest Park District, one of 22 park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. The Hermosa Improvement Association asked the Northwest Park District to develop a park in its neighborhood, and the district purchased property in 1915. The park was slow to take shape, however. Increasing industrial development adjacent to the park site initially caused many to question the location, and there was talk of selling it. The community became frustrated by the slow pace of the park's development. In late 1917, 750 citizens petitioned the district to begin park development immediately. Still, no action was taken until mid-1919, when the park district implemented a few temporary improvements.\u00a0 In 1922, the Northwest Park District vacated streets and alleys to expand the park.\u00a0 Landscape architects were not hired until two years later. In the meantime, local groups had been making regular use of the Hermosa Park property. Between 1925 and 1927, the park district finally erected a permanent fieldhouse designed by Albert A. Schwartz, the architect for a number of Northwest Park District facilities. "

The Park District installed a fieldhouse in subsequent years. Hiawatha Park honors an Onandaga Indian chief, who formed the League of Five Nations, the famed Iroquois confederation. Over the centuries, Hiawatha (ca. 1570) became an almost mystical figure for Native Americans, and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) further mythologized him in \"The Song of Hiawatha.\" The park name was suggested by community residents, who wished to carry on the tradition of naming Chicago parks for Indian tribes, people, and places.

  "history": "In the late 1960s, the City of Chicago began plans to revitalize the depressed Grand Crossing neighborhood. After deeming the community a \"Slum and Blighted Area,\" the Department of Urban Renewal proposed to build new residential housing on the existing 1/3-acre Greenwood Park, and replace the lost open space with a new two-and-a-half acre park. The new park would supplement the playground at nearby Paul Revere Elementary School, and provide improved recreational facilities for the entire community. The Chicago Park District acquired the proposed park site on South Dobson Avenue south of Oakwood Cemetery in 1972. In response to requests from many community groups, the Park District named the site in honor of Edison L. Hoard (1933-1974). A Chicago Public School counselor and teacher who began practicing law in 1965, Hoard was involved in community service for many years. He served on the Mayor's Commission on Youth Welfare, and on the boards of the Better Boys Foundation, Center for New Horizons Inc., and the Chicago Commons Foundation.

Hodes served as Chicago's Corporation Counsel from 1935 until 1947, and was a member of numerous other public and private boards over his long career. As head of the Patriotic Foundation of Chicago, Hodes was instrumental in commissioning sculptors Lorado Taft (1860-1936) and Leonard Crunelle (1872-1944) to create the patriotic monument now standing in Wacker Drive's Heald Square. Dedicated on December 19, 1941, the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the bronze statue depicts George Washington and fellow-patriots Haym Salomon and Robert Morris. Salomon, a Polish-born Jew, and Morris, an Englishman, were the primary financiers of the American Revolution. Through Hodes' further efforts, the City declared the monument its first sculptural landmark in 1971. "

  "history": "One of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, the Hollywood Park District formed in 1926 to provide recreational space for the northeastern portion of Chicago's North Park community. The fledgling park district began purchasing property two years later in 1928, acquiring 2.75 acres through 25 separate purchases by 1931.\u00a0 Land acquisition for the park was not completed until 1949.\u00a0 The site was known as Hollywood Park. Both the park and the district take their names from Hollywood Avenue, which runs through the North Park neighborhood. John Lewis Cochran, the subdivider of nearby Edgewater and a one-time resident of California, named the street for the West Coast Hollywood. Improvements began in 1931, as soon as land acquisition was complete. Within a year or two, Hollywood Park had an attractive rocky-edged goldfish pond. Concealed pipes brought water to the high points of the stone work, sending streams cascading into the pool below. Although the pool had prairie-style influences, it incorporated a variety of flowers and trees from China and Japan. Hollywood Park's design also featured a flagstone walk, a playground, a wading pool, and a baby pool with a pergola shelter. A neighboring lot was flooded for ice skating in winter. Due to the financial crisis caused by the Great Depression, this was the sole project of the Hollywood Park District. The Chicago Park District took control of the park in 1934, and rehabilitated the pond the following year. The Park District acquired additional property after World War II, more than doubling the park's size. In constructing a fieldhouse and various outdoor recreational facilities in the enlarged park, the pond and much of the original stonework was removed. Twenty years later, the Park District constructed a new spray pool and a fieldhouse addition. Improvements made during the 1990s included installation of a soft surface playground and ornamental iron fencing. "

  "history": "In 1854, real estate speculators Sherman, Clark, and Westmore reserved two acres of their subdivision as Holstein Park to enhance the area and its property values. The surrounding area was known as Holstein, an enclave of laborers and craftsmen from Schleswig - Holstein, now a region of Germany. Although the developers expected the city to beautify Holstein Park, it remained unimproved for more than 40 years. Finally, in 1901, the City transferred the park to the West Park System, which made initial improvements. By 1910, the West Park Commissioners had created several new neighborhood parks. These included the earliest west side fieldhouses, offering residents of the surrounding congested neighborhoods important services and programs such as public bathing, English lessons and other classes, and athletics. Efforts soon began to build fieldhouses in some of the existing small parks, including Holstein Park. A handsome brick fieldhouse, designed by Illinois state architect William Carbys Zimmermann, opened to the public in 1912. In 1917, the West Park Commissioners created Holstein Park by purchasing 16 lots north of what is now Palmer Street. Visionary designer Jens Jensen, then consulting landscape architect to the West Park Commission, conceived a plan to cooperatively operate Holstein Park with the adjacent Logan School. He hoped to combine the two properties, build a new school, a separate gymnasium, and an indoor swimming facility. He also wanted to create prairie-like playfields, council rings, an outdoor theater, and school gardens. Although the commissioners began negotiating with the Board of Education, the plan was never realized. Jensen's innovative idea was ahead of its time.\u00a0 In 1928, streets and alleys were vacated for park expansion and from 1928-1929, the City of Chicago acquired control of some park land.\u00a0 In 1934, the park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated.\u00a0 In 1949, the Chicago Park District acquired more land for the park.\u00a0 The Chicago Park District acquired land for the park from the City of Chicago pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act of 1957.\u00a0 In 1995, the Chicago Park District transferred part of the park to the City of Chicago.\u00a0 A recent collaboration between the City of Chicago, Chicago Park District, and Board of Education has resulted in approximately 100 campus parks throughout the city.

The new park soon included playground equipment, a small brick recreation building, and a playing field that was flooded in the winter for ice skating. The City named the park for Albert J. Horan (1894-1960), who had been elected alderman of the surrounding 29th ward the previous year--at the time, the City regularly named parks for the standing aldermen of the wards in which the sites were located. Having served as an aviator in World War I, Horan was co-founder of Cornwall Post of the American Legion. In addition to serving seven years as alderman, he was Democratic Committeeman of the 29th Ward for two decades, and Municipal Court bailiff for as long a period. Horan Park's land was officially purchased by the City in 1948. Five years later, the park was reduced slightly in size, when the southeast corner was taken for the construction of the Eisenhower Expressway. The City transferred Horan Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 In 1976, the Park District enlarged Horan Park by greening over South Albany Avenue at the edge of the park, and acquiring two acres between Albany and Kedzie Avenues.

  "history": "After 1900, Chicago's northwest side Irving Park community developed quickly. Residential construction boomed, and industries soon located along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Among these was a brick manufacturer, which excavated its riverside property for brick-making clay. Some years later, the company abandoned the site, and the clay pits became a garbage dump. Because community organizations opposed this new use, the property was eventually down-zoned from its industrial designation. In the spring of 1946, the Chicago Park District began acquiring the nearly 55-acre site as part of a ten-year, citywide plan to increase recreational opportunities throughout the city. In 1949, the Park District began demolishing the brick kilns and industrial structures and acquired more property to expand the park through land acquisition and vacating streets and alleys.\u00a0 Filling and grading were soon underway. By the early 1950s, the park had a large tobogganing hill, tennis courts, a playground, and a comfort station. A large, open meadow bordered with trees stretched across the southern section of the park. A fieldhouse was added in 1956. After adding handball courts in the 1970s and making various upgrades in the 1980s, the Park District installed a large new soft surface playground with separate areas for tots, young children, and older children. The park honors Henry Horner (1878-1940), Illinois' first Jewish governor, who served from 1933 to 1940. A native Chicagoan, Horner was appointed attorney for the Cook County Board of Assessors in 1907, and was elected judge of the Cook County Probate Court seven years later. Having gained an early, solid reputation for integrity, he won increasing popularity with diverse segments of the community. This broad-based support propelled Horner to the governorship, and fostered acceptance of a state sales tax to fund much-needed welfare programs during the Depression. A red granite monument in the northwest corner of Horner Park depicts the former governor's accomplishments. The art deco relief, carved by sculptor John David Brcin (b. 1899) in 1948, stood in Grant Park until 1956, when it was moved in time for the Horner Park fieldhouse dedication. "

  "history": "The Kenwood neighborhood, once known as the prestigious \"Lake Forest\" of Chicago's south side, experienced major changes between 1940 and 1960. African-Americans began moving in during World War II and the area's population had grown significantly by 1960. As the more affluent residents moved out, large mansions and elegant apartment houses were divided into many smaller units and the neighborhood began to decline. To reverse this trend, the Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference formed in 1949. In the early 1960s, urban renewal efforts began when a Hyde Park-Kenwood Conservation Area was established. Among the revitalization initiatives within the conservation area was the creation of a 4-acre park. The Chicago Housing Authority conveyed property to the Chicago Park District in 1963. The Park District installed volleyball and basketball courts, a playground, lawn, and plantings. The park received a new soft surface playground in 1990. In 1991, the Park District officially named the site in tribute to Rev. Jessie \"Ma\" Houston (1899-1980). After overcoming a case of childhood paralysis, Ma Houston settled in Chicago in her 20s, and began helping other disabled people. In addition to actively participating in the civil rights movement, Ma Houston was instrumental in prison reform. She was the first woman allowed to serve as a minister to prisoners on Death Row in Illinois. Under three administrations, she served on the governor's correction advisory panel. In addition, she provided support to families of incarcerated people. The Ma Houston Prison Outpost and the Washington Park Advisory Council suggested the park name. "

By that time, the City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had been operating such small municipal beaches since at least 1921. Many of these beaches were located in the Rogers Park neighborhood, where a growing population of apartment dwellers lacked easy access to recreational opportunities. In contrast to the City's larger municipal beaches, the street-end beaches, though manned by lifeguards, had no changing rooms or other facilities. Howard Avenue and the adjoining beach are named for Howard Ure (1896-1984), scion of a Rogers Park pioneer family. John Calder Ure began to farm in the Rogers Park area in the mid-19th century. His son, John F. Ure, founded the Ure Dairy on his father's property, and later donated the right-of-way for Howard Avenue.

The park was named for Alexander Von Humboldt, a German naturalist and geographer famed for his five-volume work Cosmos: Draft of a Physical Description of the World, though his single visit to the United States did not include Chicago. The creation of Humboldt and several other Westside parks is a key part of Chicago's history that provided beautiful green space and linked together the city's historic boulevard system. ",
  "history": "In 1869, shortly after the creation of the West Park System, neighborhood residents requested that the northernmost park be named in honor of Baron Freidrich Heinrich Alexander Von Humboldt (1759-1859), the famous German scientist and explorer. Two years later, completed plans for the entire ensemble of Humboldt, Garfield, and Douglas parks and connecting boulevards were completed by William Le Baron Jenney, who is best known today as the father of the skyscraper. Having studied engineering in Paris during the construction of that city's grand park and boulevard system in the 1850s, Jenney was influenced by French design. The construction of Humboldt Park was slow, however, and the original plan was followed only for the park's northeastern section.\u00a0 Land acquisition for the park was not completed until 1913. Jens Jensen, a Danish immigrant who had begun as a laborer, worked his way up to Superintendent of Humboldt Park in the mid-1890s. Unfortunately, the West Park System was entrenched in political graft at the time. The commissioners fired Jensen in 1900 because of his efforts to fight the corruption. Five years later, during major political reforms, new commissioners appointed him General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect. Deteriorating and unfinished areas of Humboldt Park allowed Jensen to experiment with his evolving Prairie style. For instance, Jensen extended the park's existing lagoon into a long meandering \"prairie river.\" Inspired by the natural rivers he saw on trips to the countryside, Jensen designed hidden water sources that supplied two rocky brooks that fed the waterway. Nearby he created a circular rose garden and an adjacent naturalistic perennial garden. Jensen designated an area diagonally across from the rose garden as a music court for dances, concerts and other special events. He commissioned Prairie School architects Schmidt, Garden, and Martin to design an impressive boat house and refectory building which still stands at one end of the historic music court. In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed a fieldhouse in Humboldt Park. The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Douglas and LaFolette Park Fieldhouses, and the On Leong Chinese Merchant's Association Building in Chinatown. In 1934, Humboldt Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when the city's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide agency. "

  "history": "Hurley Park was created by the Ridge Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Between 1920 and 1930, the population of the Ridge Park District's fashionable Beverly neighborhood increased by nearly 80%. In January, 1923, residents living in the vicinity of 100th Street and Longwood Drive petitioned for creation of a neighborhood community center there. The Ridge Park District took quick action, purchasing a 1.21 acre parcel of land the following year in 1924. In 1928, Beverly-based Hetherington & Son, Architects, designed a wading pool, shelter house, and comfort station for the small site. Long since demolished, these features nestled into the natural grades of the Tinley ground moraine. This glacial slope provides the well-drained high ground that nurtures the park's impressive stand of burr, red, and white oaks.\u00a0 The park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio in 1934 when the 22 park districts were consolidated.\u00a0 Historically, the park was informally known as 100th Street Park and Park No. 178. In 1973, the Chicago Park District officially named the property Shamrock Park as part of a city-wide program to name parks for trees and plants. In 1984, the park district renamed the site in honor of Father Timothy J. Hurley (1870--1946). Born in Ireland and ordained in Baltimore, Maryland, Father Hurley organized Beverly's St. Barnabas Catholic parish in 1924, and oversaw construction of its church building just a block from the park. Father Hurley served as St. Barnabas' pastor from its 1924 formation until his death in 1946. "

",
  "history": "Land acquisition for this park began in 1904.\u00a0 In 1907, Irving Park area residents petitioned Mayor Fred Busse for the creation of parks in their neighborhood. Mayor Busse referred the request to the City's Special Park Commission, which inspected potential park properties, including the longtime site of the neighborhood's annual Independence Day celebration. With the City's most congested districts as their focus, the commissioners could not justify creating a park in this spacious, middle-class neighborhood. State enabling legislation offered an alternative. By popular vote in 1910, community members established the Irving Park District. The new Park District soon began acquiring the previously-identified site. Though acquisition took several years, improvements began and the neighborhood continued holding its annual 4th of July festivities there. Recognizing the importance of this community celebration, the site was named Independence Park. In 1914, the park district constructed an attractive brick fieldhouse designed by Hatzfeld and Knox. Several years later, Independence Park was enlarged to Byron Street. The new property included a single-family brick home which was converted for use by the Women's Community Club. In response to requests from the public, the park district created a beautiful sunken garden with fanciful rockwork, trimmed hedges, and elaborate plantings. Colored lights illuminated the garden at night. By 1930, in addition to the garden, Independence Park included horseshoe and tennis courts, two 18-hole putting greens, playgrounds, and a wading pool.\u00a0 Land acquisition for this park was completed in 1931. In 1934, the park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio when all of the City's 22 independent park agencies were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. As part of a federal Works Progress Administration arts initiative, artist M.R. Decker created a patriotically-themed painting for Independence Park's fieldhouse auditorium.

  "history": "Indian Boundary Park takes its name from a territorial boundary established by the Treaty of 1816 between the Pottawattomie Indians and the U.S. government. The boundary line, which ran through the land that is now the park, remained in effect only through 1833, when the Pottawattomies were forced entirely from the area in the face of white settlement. Indian Boundary Park was the second and largest of the four parks created by the Ridge Avenue Park District. The others were Morse (now Matanky), Chippewa, and Pottawattomie. The Ridge Avenue district was the first of 19 neighborhood park commissions established after 1896 to serve areas recently annexed to the City. Chicago's three original park districts had authority only to create parks within the 1869 city limits. The Ridge Avenue Park District began acquiring land for Indian Boundary Park in 1915. Richard F. Gloede, a designer of North Shore estate landscapes, developed an early plan for the park. In the mid-1920s, the Ridge Avenue Park District opened a small zoo, one of only two zoos in Chicago and initially housing only a lone black bear. \u00a0Land acquisition for the park was completed in 1926.\u00a0 The 1929 Tudor-Revival fieldhouse designed by architect Clarence Hatzfeld features Native American-themed ornament inspired by the park's name. Indian Boundary Park is unusual in that its eastern lawn flows seamlessly into the front yards of neighboring apartment buildings. This park feature was so well-received that in the 1960s the Chicago Park District closed off part of adjacent Estes Avenue as well. In 2005 Indian Boundary Fieldhouse was designated a Historical Landmark by the City of Chicago and is also listed in the National Register of Historical Places. "

  "history": "After the state legislature created the South Park Commission in 1869, the renowned designers of New York's Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, were hired to lay out the 1055-acre park.\u00a0 The South Park Commissioners acquired land for the park from 1869 until 1930 through multiple sources.\u00a0 Known originally as South Park, the landscape had eastern and western divisions connected by a grand boulevard named the Midway Plaisance. The eastern division became known as Lake Park; however, in 1880 the commission asked the public to suggest official names for both the eastern and western Divisions. Jackson and Washington were proposed, and the following year, Lake Park was renamed Jackson Park to honor Andrew Jackson (1767-1845), the seventh president of the United States. In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the World's Columbian Exposition, and Jackson Park was selected as its site. Olmsted and Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H.

  "history": "The Chicago Park District acquired property for this park in 2001.\u00a0 Mahalia Jackson (1911 \u2013 1972), was a gospel singer who, during her lifetime, became famous throughout the world for her beautiful warm contralto voice. Born in New Orleans, her family exposed her to the city\u2019s influential jazz and blues musicians such as Ma Rainey and King Oliver. Jackson moved to Chicago with a maternal aunt, Hannah Robinson. She had hoped to become a nurse, but found employment instead as a laundress. The following year, she became a member of the Johnson Gospel Singers, who performed at Baptist churches, festivals, and church conventions. After the group broke up in the 1930\u2019s, she became associated with minister and pioneering gospel musician Thomas A. Dorsey. In 1937, she cut her first album on the Decca label, which hadn\u2019t previously recorded gospel music. Her career began to take off about a decade later, when her hit \u201cMove on up a Little Higher\u201d sold nearly two million copies. She went on to record with Apollo Records and Columbia Records who in 1953 billed Jackson as \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Gospel Singer.\u201d In the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, Jackson played an important role in the Civil Rights movement. In 1961, she sang at President John F. Kennedy\u2019s inaugural ball. She also helped organize and sang at several rallies and benefits in which Dr. Martin Luther King spoke. Park 386 is only four blocks away from Jackson\u2019s home at 8358 S. Indiana which she purchased in 1956. "

  "history": "In 1913, New York real estate developer William Harmon began subdividing property on both sides of the North Branch of the Chicago River to create the lovely Ravenswood Manor and Ravenswood Gardens neighborhoods. Residents soon voted to form their own park district, electing Mrs. Helen Meder the first president of its board. The new Ravenswood Manor Garden Park District was progressive -- electing a woman president, taking positions against river pollution, and stopping illegal dumping in vacant lots. However, the district had limited resources and could only afford to create very small parks. In 1915, the park district began slowly acquiring land for what became known as Jacob Park and continued to acquire land for the park until 1923. The board had hoped to construct a building in the park, however few improvements were made. For years, the park was little more than a vacant lot. Although neighborhood children played baseball there, in 1928, the park board decided to sell the land. When the \"for sale\" sign went up, local residents protested, and the sign was quickly removed. Finally, in the early 1930s, the landscape was planted, and a sand box installed. In 1934, Jacob Park became part of the newly-formed Chicago Park District. Thirty years later, the Park District installed a substantial playground, which was updated in 1991. Although long known as Jacob Park, the name may have resulted from a clerical mistake. It was originally listed as Virginia Park, but in the early 1930s, it became known by area residents as Jaeger Park in honor of Otto Jaeger a member of the Ravenswood Manor Garden Park District board from 1922 to 1934. As there is no record of the name change from Jaeger to Jacob Park, it seems likely a recording error was made during the administrative transfer to the Chicago Park District.  "

  "history": "In 1926, the City of Chicago's Bureau of Parks and Recreation began creating a two-and-a-half-acre park in the rapidly growing Albany Park neighborhood. The new park soon included a small brick recreation building, a playground, and a playing field that was flooded in the winter for ice skating. The City named the park for Christ Jensen, alderman of the surrounding 40th ward. (At the time, the city regularly named parks for the standing aldermen of the wards in which the sites were located.) Jensen Park was located within the jurisdiction of the Irving Park District, and in 1930, the City transferred the site's ownership and management to the District. The District intended to build a full-size fieldhouse with club rooms, an assembly hall, indoor gymnasiums, locker rooms, and an indoor swimming pool. Due to major funding shortages, however, the project did not move forward and the district made few park improvements to Jensen Park. In 1934, the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the city's 22 independent park agencies into the Chicago Park District. Using federal relief funds, the newly-created park district soon began work on Jensen Park. Site improvements included a wading pool, and tennis, volley ball, and basketball courts. In 1962, the Park District enlarged the original recreation building, creating a more fully-operational fieldhouse. Jensen Park received a soft surface playground in 1993.\u00a0 In 2003, streets were vacated to expand the park.\u00a0 In 2009, the Chicago Park District acquired land from the Public Commission of Chicago to complete the park\u2019s expansion.

The daughter of a free African American blacksmith, she married John Jones, the son of a freed slave. The couple the settled in Chicago in 1845, a time when there were only 140 African Americans residing in a city of 12,000. The Joneses\u2019 played an important role in the Underground Railroad Movement, which helped runaway slaves from the south relocate to the north and Canada. Their own Near South Side home provided one of only two Underground Railroad terminals in the area. This was a risky endeavor because the laws at that time made harboring fugitive slaves punishable by a large fine and possible imprisonment for free Blacks. It is believed that the Joneses help hundreds of African Americans find safety. Mary Jones was also a suffragette, and leaders in the suffrage movement such as Susan B. Anthony, stayed in the Jones home when visiting Chicago.  "

In 1981, the Park District doubled the park's size to more than two acres, purchasing the CTA land and acquiring additional property. Park facilities now include baseball fields, volleyball courts, and tennis courts. The Park District officially designated this site Jonquil Park in the mid-1970s, when a number of properties were named for plants and trees. The jonquil, a spring-blooming bulb that produces yellow or white flowers, is a type of Narcissus. According to Greek mythology, the vain Narcissus was so taken with his own reflection in a pond that the gods turned him into a flower. Jonquil Park features a bronze sculpture created in 1988 by internationally-known artist Richard Hunt, whose studio lies across the street in a converted street car barn. Inspiration for Hunt's Eagle Columns came from a Vachel Lindsay poem about Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld (1847-1902), an early proponent of neighborhood playgrounds, who once lived nearby. Funds raised in the surrounding Lincoln Park community, together with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, paid for the sculpture. Recent (2009/2010) sculpture conservation addressed bronze corrosion, graffiti residue, and staining. Stone losses at the granite bases were repaired, sinking sections of plaza paving were raised to level positions, and accessibility to the raised plaza was provided with the construction of a new ramp. Richard Hunt also designed new sculptural elements to eliminate potential damage from skateboards. "

The City's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had operated other small municipal beaches along Chicago's North Shore since at least 1921. It was the practice of the City Bureau of Parks and Recreation to use adjacent street names for identification purposes. Juneway Street was named by Sivert Tobias Gunderson, a Norwegian who came to Chicago in 1848 and made his money trading grain and lumber. Gunderson and his offspring also became real estate developers who subdivided the immediate area of the street and park.

In addition to programming, Kelly Park offers special events\u00a0including Movies in the Park screenings and other Night Out in the Parks special events. ",
  "history": "Soon after World War II, the Chicago Park District and the Board of Education began providing cooperative programs in many of the city's rapidly growing neighborhoods. Known as the school-park plan, the intent was to save money and utilize buildings to the fullest extent by sharing facilities. To create a park across the street from Thomas Kelly High School, the Park District began leasing part of the seven-acre site from the Board of Education. The District had to condemn the remainder from reluctant home owners.\u00a0 Streets were vacated in 1951 and 1953 for park property and the remaining park property was finally acquired in 1953, and the Engineering Department began preparing plans for the new park. By 1953, the park included a large athletic field, a smaller practice field, horseshoe courts, a children's playground, and plantings. Three years later, the Park District constructed a small brick fieldhouse there. This jointly operated site has always provided Park District athletic programs which are run out of the high school. In 1991, the Board of Education transferred its part of the site to the Park District. Although the adjacent high school is named for 28th Ward alderman and Chicago Drainage Board president Thomas Kelly (1843-1914), the park's name honors Edward J. Kelly (1876-1950), fourteen-year mayor of Chicago. Having grown up in the Back of the Yards and Brighton Park neighborhoods, Kelly began working as a newsboy at the age of 9. He held many different jobs while attending school, and worked his way up to Chief Engineer for the Sanitary District. Appointed to the board of the South Park Commission in 1922, he became president the following year. Kelly was a member of the committee that nominated Anton J. Cermak for the state legislature. When, as Mayor, Cermak was shot by an assassin, the city council elected Kelly to fill Cermak's unexpired term. Serving three more terms as mayor, Kelly helped Chicago cope with the Great Depression and realize major construction projects such as the City's subway system. "

  "history": "Kelvyn was among the original parks created by the Northwest Park District, which first formed in 1911. At that time, the Northwest Park District aimed to provide one park for each of the ten square miles within its growing middle-class jurisdiction. The park district began purchasing land for Mozart, Kelyvn, and Kosciuszko Parks in early 1914, receiving input from the Special Parks Commission and the West End Fullerton Avenue Improvement Association on how to develop the park.\u00a0 Land acquisition for the park was not completed until 1916 by acquiring more property and vacating streets and alleys.\u00a0 The district hired American Park Builders Inc. to produce the landscape design for Kelvyn Park. (The American Park Builders also designed Portage Park.) In 1928, a handsome two-story brick field house was constructed in Kelvyn Park. Designed by architect Walter W. Ahlschlager (1887\u20131965), the building is nearly identical to the field houses at Riis and Simons Parks. Kelvyn Park takes its name from the surrounding Kelvyn Park subdivision. The subdivision honors British Baronet William Thomson Kelvyn (1824\u20131907), an eminent mathematician and physicist whose scientific research revolutionized thinking about the thermal properties of steam. Kelvyn Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio in 1934, when all of the City\u2019s 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into a single agency. "

The City transferred Kenmore Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. In the late 1980s, teenagers and adults playing basketball routinely disturbed neighbors and drove younger children from the park. Therefore, the Park District removed the half-court and original playground equipment and installed a new soft surface playground with swing sets and climbing apparatus, devoting the park entirely to young children.

  "history": "At 18 acres, Kennedy Park was by far the largest park created by the Calumet Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. The Calumet District began to purchase land for this park in 1911 at the urging of Morgan Park residents. By 1912, the Calumet Park District had completed acquisition of a dump site and an existing ball field for park development. The Park District immediately erected a bath house. Fourteen years later, a swimming pool was added. Although much of the property remained unimproved through the 1920s, the park district worked with the Morgan Park Woman's Club to create a bird sanctuary and wild flower preserve on 5 undeveloped acres. The park district began full-scale improvements in 1930, using labor from the state's Unemployed Relief Service. The laborers removed hundreds of tons of old auto frames and concrete from the site, graded it, planted trees and shrubbery, and constructed a fieldhouse, all by hand. The Chicago Park District took control of Kennedy Park in 1934 when the 22 Park Districts were consolidated, and constructed a new pool and fieldhouse in the early 1960s. Initially known as Western Avenue Park, the park received the name D.J. Kennedy Memorial Park in 1932. The new name honors Dennis J. Kennedy (1871-1932), a member of the Calumet Park District commission from 1910 until his death in 1932, and its president for twenty years. "

After Kenwood's annexation to Chicago in 1889, the city's elite flowed into the neighborhood, building substantial, well-designed homes. Fashionable Kenwood began to decline in the 1920s, however. Some single-family homes were subdivided into multi-family dwellings. High-rise apartment houses replaced others. Kenwood's population jumped by 28% during the decade. To create parkland for the growing community, the Chicago Board of Education acquired property in 1931 on East 50th Street.\u00a0 The City's Board of Education soon transformed the site into a playground. After the Chicago Board of Education transferred the park property to the City of Chicago in 1943, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation planted 12 large American Elms to shade the ball diamonds and jungle gym. By 1950, the park was well-equipped with additional playground apparatus, a small brick recreation building, and a playing field that could be flooded in winter for ice skating. The City transferred Kenwood Community Park to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act. The following year, when adjacent Kenwood Avenue closed and the new Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School was constructed just to the west, the Park District responded by rehabilitating the park. In addition to earlier park amenities, the redesign included tennis and horseshoe courts and a spray pool. Since 1961, the park and the school properties have been jointly operated by the Park District and the Board of Education. "

Initially known as Austinville, and later as Austin, the community's population surged with its 1899 annexation to Chicago. In 1908, the city's Special Park Commission began improving a strip of land north of Kinzie Street with trees and shrubs. The commission envisioned Kinzie Street Parkway as a connecting link between a number of west side parks. These included Merrick (now Levin) Park and Austin Park, both designed in 1906 by renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen, a member of the Special Park Commission. The park was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1957 pursuant to the Chicago Park and City Exchange of Functions Act.\u00a0 Kinzie Parkway Park remains one of a small number of Chicago parks used exclusively for passive recreation. Both the park and the adjacent street honor John Kinzie (1763-1828), one of Chicago's earliest settlers. Born in Quebec to a British army surgeon who died young, Kinzie apprenticed as a silversmith. Having spent many years trapping and trading in the north woods, Kinzie arrived in Chicago in 1804. He developed friendly relations with local Native Americans, quickly rising to prominence in the frontier community. When Potawatomis attacked Federal troops fleeing Fort Dearborn, Kinzie and his family managed to escape unharmed with the help of Billy Caldwell, a half-Irish Potawatomi chief. Returning to Chicago in 1816, Kinzie resumed his Indian trading, but never regained his earlier stature. "

Established in 1917, the Albany Park District had two aims: to beautify the banks of the Chicago River's North Branch, which flows through the area, and to provide up-to-date park facilities for its rapidly-expanding population. To these ends, the Albany Park District purchased a triangular property on the north bank of the river in 1923. Improvements began immediately. In 1926, the park district erected a small brick fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld, architect of a number of Chicago park buildings.\u00a0 Albany Park District is one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, which is when Kiwanis Park became part of the Chicago Park District\u2019s portfolio. The following year, the park was dedicated in honor of the Kiwanis Club of Albany Park for their civic and charitable service to the community. Kiwanis Park is now used exclusively for passive recreation. The original fieldhouse and playground equipment were razed in 1975 due to ongoing problems with vandalism. The park, which lies adjacent to Von Stueben High School (as well as to North Park College & Seminary), has been jointly operated by the Chicago Park District and the Board of Education since 1997 as part of their \"Campus Park\" initiative.

  "history": "Lois Klein Park was created by the Chicago Park District when the District acquired land in 2010 after several years of planning and land acquisition. Designed by the Hitchcock Design Group, the park has a whimsical playground. In 2011, the Chicago Park District\u2019s Board of Commissioners named the park in honor of Lois Klein, a neighborhood activist who inspired members of the Lakeview community in the 1980s and 1990s. Born and raised in Chicago Lois Klein (1931-1997) lived for over 30 years just two blocks from the site that now bears her name. During her life, she made many positive contributions to her neighborhood by participating in community meetings and volunteering for the local alderman\u2019s office. However, the bulk of her energy was focused on helping children. For many years she volunteered at two local schools, John J. Audubon Elementary School and St. Andrew School. Ms. Klein\u2019s concern about neighborhood children prompted her to advocate for safety improvements to address the dangerous intersection at Lincoln Ave., Addison St., and Ravenswood Ave. She rallied the community to petition for improvements at the intersection. Ironically, in 1997, Lois Klein was struck by a car at that very intersection. Due to Ms. Klein\u2019s tragic death, the intersection was soon modernized and made safer for pedestrians and vehicular traffic. "

  "history": "In April of 2022, the park was renamed in honor of celebrated poet and writer Gertrud Kolmar, who was born in Berlin in 1894 and\u00a0was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943. Gertrud Kolmar is considered one of the greatest German language poets of all time, as well as one of the greatest poets of Jewish descent. Kolmar's surviving work consists of four hundred and fifty poems, three plays, and two short stories. Due to the efforts by leaders in both Chicago's Old Irving Park neighborhood and Jewish Community, the park was rededicated to honor Gertrud Kolmar. Originally, Kolmar Park took its name from adjoining Kolmar Avenue, named for a European city located on the border between France and Germany. Plans for the park began in 1929 when the Irving Park District ordered a survey of its .8-acre site and acquired the property that same year. The Park District intended to build a small fieldhouse and separate boys' and girls' playgrounds there, but due to a major funding shortage, only minimal site improvements were undertaken. In 1934, the Great Depression necessitated the consolidation of the City's 22 independent park agencies into the Chicago Park District. Using federal relief funds, the newly-created Park District soon began work to complete Kolmar Park. The Park District improved the site with a playground and a playing field that was flooded for ice skating in the winter. In the early 1990s, Kolmar Park received a soft surface playground, and the entire site was enclosed with new ornamental fencing. "

Originally known as Claremont Park for the adjacent street, the playground was renamed Korczak Park in 1974, at the request of Skokie's Janusz Korczak Chapter of B'nai B'rith. The new name honors Dr. Janusz Korczak (1878-1942), a Polish educator, writer, and pediatrician well known for work with parentless children. Dr. Korczak founded and directed orphanages for Jewish and Catholic children, whom he encouraged to be as independent as possible. Passing up a number of opportunities to flee Nazi-occupied Poland, Dr. Korczak chose instead to accompany his charges when they were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka death camp.

  "history": "In 1918, renowned landscape architect Jens Jensen envisioned a new type of neighborhood center for Chicago's west side.He imagined public schools surrounded by naturalistic landscapes with recreational and cultural features for people of all ages. Jensen created a plan to integrate new parkland with Lloyd School in the Austin neighborhood. Recommending the demolition of the existing school and acquisition of adjacent land, Jensen conceived adjoining school and gymnasium buildings in a beautiful setting with children's gardens, a bird garden, a naturalistic swimming lagoon, prairie-like playfields, and an outdoor theater. The West Park Commission acquired the proposed site, and began negotiating with the Board of Education. Shifting political tides, however, caused Jensen to sever his relationship with the park commission and the plan was never realized. The site remained unimproved for many years. In 1925, the commissioners received a letter from the West Town Chamber of Commerce stressing the need for park improvements. The following year, the site was officially named La Follette Park after a delegation submitted petitions signed by 100,000 citizens requesting this tribute. Robert M. La Follette (1855-1925), a U.S. Representative, Senator, and three term Wisconsin governor, was nationally known for Progressive reform efforts to better the lives of children, women, farmers, and workers. Nicknamed \"Fighting Bob,\" La Follette was recognized as an exceptional orator who battled against corruption. In 1927, voters approved a $10 million bond issue allowing the West Park Commission to construct a number of new park buildings and landscape improvements.The initiative included $600,000 for a fieldhouse in La Follette Park. Designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, the impressive Italian Renaissance Revival-style building, with its large auditorium, two gymnasiums, indoor swimming pool, lobbies, promenade, and gallery, was considered a fitting memorial to the revered La Follette.

  "history": "During and after World War I, many African-Americans arrived in the Douglas neighborhood from the rural south, and the community soon became the heart of Black Chicago. By the early 1940s, government urban renewal projects led to the demolition of much of the neighborhood's aging housing stock. New construction, primarily in the form of public housing, took its place. In the 1950s, the Chicago Land Clearance Commission purchased and leveled 100 acres of decaying buildings around 31st Street and South Parkway (now Martin Luther King Drive). The commission sold much of the property to private developers for construction of Lake Meadows, an enormous residential and commercial complex designed by the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill. The developers hoped to attract residents of various racial and economic backgrounds and to promote community renewal. In the mid-1950s, the Land Clearance Commission sold additional acreage to both the Chicago Park District and the Board of Education. After developing a plan for its newly-acquired property in 1957, the park district improved it with a playground, an athletic field, and a shaded lawn for picnicking and public events. Adjacent John J. Pershing Elementary School was completed in 1958, and the park district immediately began to manage the school grounds as part of the park. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, improvements included additional trees and a new soft surface playground. A mobile trailer provides fieldhouse facilities for Lake Meadows Park. "

  "history": "Lake Shore Park was planned for years before development began by the Lincoln Park Commission just before 1900. The Lincoln Park Commission was one of three Chicago park boards created by the Illinois state legislature in 1869. Twenty years later, the legislature gave a section of accumulating duneland north of Chicago Avenue to the park commission. The City of Chicago challenged the commission's ownership, but the matter was resolved in the commission's favor in 1895. Shortly thereafter, plans were drawn for what was initially known as Chicago Avenue Park. In 1897, the commission began stabilizing and expanding the site with landfill, a process that would continue for many years. Landscape improvements began in 1900. In 1907, the Lincoln Park Commission agreed to expand the park by improving city land just west of the park. At the time, the Lincoln Park Commission was a leader in a national movement toward neighborhood parks. The commission's efforts included Seward and Stanton parks, developed during the same period. In 1908, the commission officially named the expanded property Lake Shore Playground, in recognition of its location. A shelter house was erected, and outdoor recreational facilities installed. By 1915, the city had reclaimed its land, transferring it to the State of Illinois for an armory. The commission completely redesigned the remaining parkland in the following years. Demolishing the original shelter house, the commission constructed a new brick fieldhouse. The 1916 fieldhouse sat at the east end of the park, facing Lake Shore Drive and Lake Michigan. A running track, baseball diamond, and tennis courts stretched to the west. The Chicago Park District took control of Lake Shore Park in 1934, when the 22 city park districts were consolidated into a single unified district. In 1963, the park district dismantled the 1916 structure and built yet another fieldhouse on the park's eastern border. The armory to the west was demolished in the 1990s, and Lake Shore Park is now bordered by the stepped terraces of the new Museum of Contemporary Art, designed by Josef Paul Kleihues. "

The park district then selected an alternate site combining private and county-owned land at the northeast corner of the same intersection. By 1977, the park district had entered into a lease with Cook County and purchased the private land. The triangular site soon included turf, plantings, playground equipment, and a combined volleyball and basketball court. In 1980, in response to requests from the Block Club and the Morgan Park Civic League, the park district named the park in tribute to Harold Lamb (1917-1978).

In contrast to the city's larger municipal beaches, the street-end beaches, though manned by lifeguards, had no changing rooms or other facilities. Residents of the north Edgewater neighborhood welcomed the recreational outlet provided by Lane Beach and other small beaches. Although the Lincoln Park Board had at one time contemplated expanding Lincoln Park north to Devon Avenue, the planned expansion never took place, and north Edgewater was left without easy access to Lincoln Park's spacious beaches. (Lincoln Park reached its present northern boundary of Ardmore Avenue in 1956.) Known for years as Thorndale Avenue Beach and Park, the park was renamed in May, 1975 for George A.

The City of Chicago purchased the property at the corner of North Ravenswood and Albion Streets in 1950. The city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation operated the site as Albion Park until 1959, when the Chicago Park District acquired it. Langdon (1918-1993), who went by the nickname Megs, was an accomplished university administrator and community activist in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods. In the 1970s, she was appointed Director of Community Programs Office at Loyola University Chicago where she remained until her retirement. Ms. Langdon played an active role in numerous community efforts and organizations including the Chicago Crime Commission, St. Joseph Hospital Executive Advisory Committee, the Chicago Planning Commission, and the Rogers Park Community Council.

Gunderson & Sons, a 19th-century Chicago real estate development firm. The family patriarch, Sivert Tobias Gunderson (1839--), had come to Chicago from Norway in 1848 and made his money trading grain and lumber. He eventually bought a commercial lake vessel, a sawmill, and significant amounts of real estate. The Gundersons also named two other Chicago streets, Gladys and Haskins, for S.T.'s granddaughter Gladys Haskins. Gladys' name also graces a west side park. "

  "history": "Chicago's Clearing community remained sparsely populated until the 1940s, when industrial development on the southwest side and in nearby suburbs brought a surge of residential construction to the area. Among the new developments was the Lawler Park subdivision, established in 1944. In 1947, the City of Chicago began creating a 6.2-acre park in the new subdivision. By 1950, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had improved the site with a sand box and playground equipment. Clearing's population again increased significantly during the following decade. To meet the needs of the rapidly-growing community, the bureau began extensive improvements in 1958, upgrading the playground equipment and adding basketball and volleyball courts, as well as a brick recreation building. The city transferred Lawler Park to the Chicago Park District the following year. In 1985, after obtaining a $100,000 appropriation from the State of Illinois, the park district thoroughly rehabilitated the athletic field and the playground area. Further planting and playground improvements were made during the 1990s. Originally known as Leamington Park for the street to the west, by 1958, the park had been give the name of the surrounding subdivision. The park, the subdivision, and nearby Lawler Avenue all honor the memory of Union General Michael K. Lawler (1814-1882). Born in Kildare, Ireland, Lawler emigrated to the United States, fought in the Mexican War, and was made a general by Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War. "

She is best known for her poem \"New Colossus,\" written in 1883, and inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty two decades later. Her widely-recognized lines read in part: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore, send these, the homeless, tempest-tost, to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\" The Lazarus Park designation, made at the request of the Rogers Park Chapter of Emma Lazarus Jewish Women's Clubs, was deemed an appropriate commemoration of the Statue of Liberty's 100th anniversary in 1986.

  "history": "The Chicago Park District planned and developed LeClaire-Hearst Park in conjunction with the Chicago Housing Authority's construction of the nearby LeClaire Courts public housing project. The park district first purchased land for the park in 1948, acquiring additional property from C.H.A. in 1968 and from the Board of Education in 1991. In 1974, the park was officially designated LeClaire Courts - Hearst Community Park for the neighboring communities. The park district expanded the park with Board of Education land in 1991.\u00a0 In 1999, the LeClaire Courts-Hearst Community Center Park name was officially changed to LeClaire-Hearst Park.\u00a0 The purpose of this name's amendment was to prevent confusion due to another agency in the community already having been named LeClaire-Hearst Community Center. LeClaire Courts, which opened in 1950, was Chicago's first attempt at integrated, lowrise public housing. The complex takes its name from Antoine Le Claire, a fur trader and government interpreter who came to Chicago with John Kinzie (1763-1828) in 1809. LeClaire Street, which terminates at the south edge of the park, also bears his name. Hearst is the single-family residential community south of 45th Street. Its name derives from that of philanthropist Phoebe Apperson Hearst (1842-1919), mother of newspaper publisher and businessman William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951). "

  "history": "Chicago's Ashburn community remained sparsely populated until the late 1940s, when industrial development on the southwest side and in nearby suburbs prompted a surge in residential construction. Ashburn's population increased dramatically after 1950, rising from 7,000 residents to 40,000 in just ten years. The Parkview Civic Association, a local homeowners' group, began to lobby for a small park at South Lawndale Avenue and 87th Street, Ashburn's southern border. The City of Chicago agreed to purchase the quarter-acre lot in 1958, and acquired the property two years later. The city immediately transferred the property to the Chicago Park District as required by the Functional Consolidation Act of 1959. The park district developed the site as a playground in 1962, rehabilitating it thirty years later. In early 1963, the park district officially named the park for John M. Lee (1886-1956), a five-term Democratic Committeeman for the surrounding 18th Ward. Lee played an active role in public life, serving as state representative from 1922 to 1932 and as state senator from 1933 to 1946.

  "history": "Legion Park was created by the River Park District, one of 22 independent park systems consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Residents of northwest Chicago established the Ridge Park District in 1917 specifically to promote recreational opportunities along the North Shore Channel and the nearby North Branch of the Chicago River. Therefore, when the board of the Sanitary District of Chicago offered to lease a 330-foot, 18-acre stretch of the channel's east bank in 1930, the River Park District readily accepted. The park district named the site Legion Park to honor veterans who served in the World War I U.S. Expeditionary Forces, and promptly began improvements, installing a playground, a volleyball court, a softball field, and an outdoor gymnasium. In 1933, the Garden Club of the Peterson Woods Improvement Association planted a flower garden in the park. The following year, in the depths of the Depression, the Illinois Relief Commission erected a rustic bridge across the channel at Ardmore Avenue. All 22 of the city's independent park boards were consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. In 1962, the park district began to lease additional property on both sides of the channel. Seven years later, the park district leased still more land, bringing total park acreage to 48.35 acres. Over time, the park district has installed and improved concrete walkways, bike paths, and playgrounds along the length of Legion Park. In 1999, the park district purchased .4 acres of land at the corner of Lincoln and Peterson Avenues from the Public Building Commission, and removed a neighborhood eyesore, a dilapidated motel. This property, with its new ornamental fountain, will serve as a gateway to the park "

The city had purchased the property and its pumping station from the Rogers Park Water Company in 1907. Shortly after obtaining the lakeshore property, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation remodeled the pumping station, built in 1900, for use as a fieldhouse. The park's Touhy Avenue beach included diving boards and rafts that drew neighborhood children in droves. By 1937, the park comprised 250 feet of beach frontage, including street-end beaches at Chase, Greenleaf, and Farwell Avenues. In 1959, the Chicago Park District began leasing the park, then known as Rogers Park and Beach, from the city. In 1966, the park district renamed the site Leone Park after beloved park district employee Sam Leone (1900-1965). Leone joined the Bureau of Parks and Recreation as a lifeguard after serving in the Navy during World War I. Initially, he worked at the old Clarendon Park Beach, but was moved north to Rogers Park in 1927. When Leone became a park district employee in 1959, he was named supervisor of lifeguards for the entire north side.

  "history": "Lerner Park sits on a remnant of the West Ridge community's once-thriving brick-making industry. Drawn by the area's natural deposits of clay and sand, brick-makers increasingly located in the western portion of the community after 1900. Their workers soon followed, building bungalows in the surrounding area. By mid-century, the local brick industry had faded, but population was surging. To meet the recreational needs of West Ridge residents, the Chicago Park District purchased this former clay pit from the Illinois Brick Company in 1962. The park district improved the 8-acre site in 1964 and 1965. The park district and the Chicago Board of Education agreed to jointly operate the new park and adjacent Stephen Decatur Elementary School, but the project was short-lived. In 1966, the park was named for Leo Lerner (1908--1965), an eminent author, publisher, and public-spirited citizen.

  "history": "In 1866, the year after Henry W. Austin developed a large portion of Cicero Township as Austinville, approximately 20 acres were recorded as Merrick's Subdivision. At the time, developers were worried that fire could spread quickly through newly-constructed neighborhoods, and they often set small parcels of open space aside to provide some protection. Within Merrick's Subdivision, 6.5 acres were designated as parkland. By the 1880s, the site comprised only a planted area enclosed by a white picket fence. At each corner entrance were wooden arches bearing the name \"Merrick Park\" in large black letters. In 1899, the City of Chicago annexed Austinville, and within the next few years the park came under the jurisdiction of the Special Park Commission. In 1906, renowned designer Jens Jensen, serving as a member of the Special Park Commission, developed improvement plans for a number of city parks. In Merrick Park, Jensen created two circular meadows and walkways, and densely planted trees and shrubs. There was also a combination tool shed and comfort station which was constructed in 1907. Although the park did not have playground equipment, it offered lawn tennis during the warmer months and ice skating in winter. The city transferred Merrick Park to the Chicago Park District along with more than 250 other properties in 1959. The existing building was converted and expanded into a small fieldhouse in 1972. At the same time, the park district installed new basketball and volleyball courts, playground equipment, and baseball backstops. In 1974, the site was renamed Levin Park as a tribute to John H. (\"Little Jack\") Levin (1887-1971). For 57 years, Levin owned Little Jack's Restaurant, a neighborhood institution and favorite spot for boxers who came after matches at Chicago Stadium, as well as Democratic politicians and judges.

Under a lease agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority, the Chicago Park District assumed operation and maintenance of the site, after the City installed a playground and basketball courts. In 1991, after determining that the park was not well utilized by younger children, the park district removed the playground and added a second basketball court. The Chicago Park District named the park in honor of Margaret Hie Ding Lin in 2004 as part of a system-wide effort to recognize the contributions of Chicago women. Margaret Hie Ding Lin (1888\u20131973), one of Chicago\u2019s first Chinese physicians, played an active role in providing medical services to the residents of Chinatown. Margaret graduated from Fuzhou College (a Chinese university founded by Western missionaries) in 1907. She then came to the United States to attend medical school. She was one of the nation\u2019s earliest Chinese immigrants to attend medical school, and of course few women became doctors at that time. Margaret received her medical school training at the University of Illinois in Chicago. She went on to an internship at the Mary Thompson Hospital for Women and Children in Chicago. After completing her internship, she returned to China where she had a prestigious career as a doctor and hospital president. In 1941, more than twenty years after her return to China, she came back to Chicago. She worked at the University of Illinois Medical Center for several years and then began working for the Illinois Dept. of Public Welfare. To help Chicago\u2019s Chinese residents, Margaret established a medical practice in Chinatown. On weekdays, Margaret took care of patients at the Cook County Tuberculosis Hospital, and during the weekends she attended to her patients in Chinatown. She was revered by the Chinatown community, and in 1964, area residents successfully nominated her to the Senior Citizens Hall of Fame in Chicago. Margaret Hie Ding Lin Park is less than a mile away from Chinatown, the community to which she devoted much of her life and professional energies. "

Most notably, Lincoln Park is the result of a long-standing commitment by city leaders and citizens to protect 1,200 acres of some of Chicago's most valuable lakefront real estate for the public's use and benefit. ",
  "history": "Lincoln Park began as a small public cemetery on the northernmost boundary of Chicago where victims of cholera and small pox were buried in shallow lakeside graves. Aware of the public health threat, citizens began demanding the cemetery's conversion to parkland in the 1850s. In 1860, the city reserved a 60-acre unused section as Lake Park. Shortly after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (1809-65), 16th President of the United States, the park was renamed in his honor. The city allocated $10,000 for improvements, and nurseryman Swain Nelson created and implemented the park's first plan. An early donation of mute swans marked the beginnings of the Lincoln Park Zoo. Citizens argued for the removal of the remaining burial ground. This contributed to a larger parks movement, and in 1869, the state legislature created three park districts: the South, West, and Lincoln Park Commissions, each responsible for the parks and boulevards in its region. Under the direction of the Lincoln Park Commission, bodies were exhumed and relocated to other cemeteries, and the park was expanded south to North Avenue and north to Diversey Parkway. Severe winter storms in 1885 resulted in the construction of a breakwater system which included the first of many landfill projects extending Lincoln Park's boundaries. The independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, and Lincoln Park was expanded north to Foster Avenue. A final expansion in the 1950s brought the park to its current size of 1,208 acres. Throughout Lincoln Park's history, renowned artists, landscape designers, and architects contributed to its development. These included sculptor Augustus-Saint Gaudens, landscape designers Ossian Cole Simonds and Alfred Caldwell, and architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Dwight H. Perkins. "

This Ten Year Plan identified 43 sites in neighborhoods with few recreational facilities and in undeveloped areas which were starting to boom. In 1949, the effort's fourth year, the park district acquired a 17-acre property in the under-served West Englewood neighborhood. Improved between 1950 and 1952, the new park included an athletic field, a children's playground, tennis and volley ball courts, and a small frame and sheet metal recreation building. Basketball courts were added in 1958. In 1983, the park district demolished the recreation building and replaced it with a modern fieldhouse, nearly identical with structures built the same year in Rowan and Fernwood Parks. Two years later, an outdoor swimming pool and a changing facility were constructed in the park. In the 1990s, the park district replanted Lindblom Park's landscape, built a soft surface playground, and installed flood lights around the basketball courts, allowing for night-time games. The park's name honors Chicago businessman and philanthropist Robert Lindblom (1844-1907). Having emigrated from Sweden at the age of 20, Lindblom settled in Chicago in 1877, and worked as a grain operator on the Board of Trade. He served on the organizing committee for the World's Columbian Exposition, raising a half-million dollars to help finance the fair which opened in Jackson Park in 1893. For helping the Swedish government with its fair exhibit, Lindblom was knighted by King Oscar. Linblom served on the Board of Education from 1893 to 1896. "

The park was one of a number of park district properties named for trees and plants in the mid-1970s. The district's park naming committee felt that neighborhood children could relate well to park names chosen from nature. The linden is a medium-sized to large tree found throughout the North American temperate zone. The many nutrients in the decaying leaves of lindens play an important role in building soil fertility. The linden's flowers provide nectar for bees, while the fruit, bark, and twigs serve as food for other wildlife. Native Americans twisted fibers from the tough inner bark into rope. They used finer linden bark threads to suture wounds and to weave cloth. "

",
  "history": "Loyola Park was the sole park created by the North Shore Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Unlike most of these park boards, the North Shore District, formed in 1900, was at first interested only in enhancing the area through boulevard improvements along Sheridan Road, Pratt Boulevard, and Ashland Avenue. By 1905, however, public pressure had prompted the district to consider park development. The district spent several years mulling its options. Finally, in 1909, at the urging of the Rogers Park Woman's Club, the North Shore District determined to concentrate its resources on purchasing land for a single beachfront park and boating basin known as North Shore Park. Shortly thereafter, noted landscape architect and engineer O.C. Simonds developed plans for a pier at the site, but these were never realized. By 1917, the North Shore District had acquired more than nine acres of lakeshore property. A small fieldhouse, built in 1923, soon provided game and club rooms. Playfields were flooded for ice skating in winter; in 1929, the local American Legion post erected a shelter house for skaters. Several years after the Chicago Park District took over in 1934, local residents asked that North Shore Park be renamed. The park district agreed, and held a contest to choose a new name. Neighborhood residents favored the name Loyola Park, for nearby Loyola University. The Jesuits began to develop this important Rogers Park institution in 1906, when they purchased a 20-acre site between Devon and Loyola Avenues. During the 1930s, the university raised its neighborhood profile substantially by constructing a number of dramatic Art Deco buildings, including the Madonna della Strada Chapel. Around 1950, the Chicago Park District more than doubled the size of Loyola Park and built a new fieldhouse with an adjacent grandstand. Another half-acrewas added1971, bringing the size ofLoyola Park to more than 21.5 acres. "

  "history": "With the end of World War II came a residential building boom in the South Deering community. The area's population nearly doubled between 1940 and 1950. To ensure recreational opportunities for residents, the City of Chicago acquired a parcel of land from real estate subdividers in 1946, improving it as a playground. In 1959, the city turned the park over to the Chicago Park District. Luella Park takes its name from the street that runs along its western edge. The Luella was the first passenger steamer to ply the Mississippi River. Built in 1844 by George Springer (1815-1899) of St. Louis, the Luella was the only means of crossing between St. Louis and the higher eastern shore of the river during the great flood of that year. Springer sold the vessel in 1848 and moved to Chicago to speculate in real estate. Springer found further success; it was Springer himself who named the street, which ran through one of his new subdivisions. "

  "history": "In 1917, the Chicago & Western Indiana Railroad began elevating its tracks as part of a city-wide effort to eliminate dangerous at-grade crossings. In 1920, Alderman John H. Lyle (1882-1964) asked the City Council to establish a new park along the newly-created embankment on the railroad's western right-of-way between 76th and 79th Streets. By the following year, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had named the 3-acre greenspace Lyle Park. (At the time, the bureau regularly named parks for standing aldermen.) An Indiana native and graduate of John Marshall Law School, Lyle began his political career in 1910 as an Assistant Cook County State's Attorney. In 1914, he became a state legislator, and served as alderman from 1918 until 1925. In 1925, Lyle was elected to the Municipal Court, a position from which he relentlessly battled organized crime. Lyle coined the term \"public enemies\" for gangland criminals, and gained a reputation as the only Chicago judge that Al Capone could not buy. In fact, it was Lyle who issued the warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of tax evasion in 1930. By 1940, Lyle Park had shrunk to just 1.6 acres, stretching south only as far as 78th Street. Though the Bureau of Parks and Recreation developed a plan for enhancing the site with playground equipment, no such improvements were made. In 1959, the city transferred Lyle Park, along with more than 250 other park properties, to the Chicago Park District. In the 1970s, the park district installed playground equipment near 77th Street. The playground was rehabilitated in 1992. "

Population increased gradually until the 1950s, when construction of the Dan Ryan Expressway cut through the heart of the community, with devastating results. Fuller Park's population dropped precipitously between 1950 and 1970. About 1970, representatives of the Firman Neighborhood House, a community service organization, urged the Chicago Park District to purchase property for playlot development in the neighborhood. Using funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the park district acquired land in 1974, improving it with playground equipment, a sand box, permanent game tables, and plantings. In the late 1980s, the playground was rehabilitated and the landscape replanted. Officially named Malus Park in 1974, the park was one of a number of properties named for trees and plants at the time. The Latin term malus refers to the genus of trees that includes apples, crabapples, and pears, though pears are sometimes categorized as a separate genus, pyrus. All are ornamental or fruit-bearing trees that produce an abundance of white to pink flowers. Crabapples, in particular, add beauty to many Chicago parks, including this one, where both malus hopa and malus radiant grow. "

Numerous public meetings were held to obtain the views of residents of Douglas to the north and Grand Boulevard to the south concerning how best to design the park to draw the two communities together. After acquiring the property in 1998, the Chicago Park District developed plans for a multi-purpose athletic field, a running track, and a landscaped border to buffer the park from traffic. Work on the park continues. The park honors Henry McNeil \"Mandrake\" Brown (1935-1996), who initiated grassroots efforts to eliminate alcohol- and tobacco-related billboards specifically targeting African-American and Latino children. Using the name Mandrake to shield his identity, Brown began whitewashing objectionable billboards in 1990. The first of these billboards was located at Oakwood Boulevard and Pershing Road. Brown's efforts became the basis for preventing Powere Master Malt Liquor from being marketed to African-Americans; removing 700 illegal billboards in Chicago through use of Chicago's zoning laws; and removing alcohol and tobacco billboards located within 500 feet of schools and churches.

  "history": "In 1883, Achilles Hegewisch determined to establish an \"ideal workingman's community\" at the south end of Lake Calumet. He moved his United States Rolling Stock Company to the area, built worker housing, and encouraged other industrialists to do the same. Unfortunately, Hegewisch's death in the 1890s pushed the area into decline. Hoping to better the community's prospects, civic groups in 1907 lobbied the South Park Commission to develop a neighborhood park. The following year, the commission purchased the 20 acres that would become Mann Park. The property was one of four sites the commission acquired at the time to expand its revolutionary system of neighborhood parks, the first ten of which had opened in 1905 (another four had been temporarily delayed). The original ten, with their innovative fieldhouses, were an immediate success. In 1910, the South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers, landscape designers for the previous neighborhood parks, to lay out the four new parks. Although the commission chose not to use these plans, in-house designers developed a new set of plans inspired by them. The plan for Mann Park was virtually identical to those implemented at the three other parks, Grand Crossing, Trumbull, and Tuley Parks. Filling and grading began at once and improvements soon followed, however, the Olmsted-inspired plan was never fully realized at Mann Park. The park's fieldhouse was not completed until 1934, the year the Chicago Park District took over. With its ecclectic style and red tile roof, the Mann Park fieldhouse was very different from the earlier classical buildings at Trumbull and Grand Crossing Parks. Originally known as Hegewisch Park, this park was designated Mann Park in 1922. James R. Mann (1856-1922) served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1897 until his death in 1922. Prior to his election, Mann had served as attorney for the South Park Commission. "

Maple trees are a major component of northern temperate forests, providing food for many birds and mammals. The 13 maple species native to North America range in size from shrubs to large trees. Widely recognized for their colorful autumn leaves, maples produce syrup that flows in the early spring, before leaves appear. "

By 1950, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had improved the site with a sand box, a compact brick recreation building, and a playfield that could be flooded for ice skating in winter. Following its general practice at the time, the bureau named the park for adjacent Maplewood Avenue. The street takes its name from the Village of Maplewood, founded in 1869 on land purchased by New Yorker Justin Butterfield (1790-1855) 26 years before. The maple groves that likely gave the village its name have long since disappeared, and the nearby Logan Square neighborhood stands in their place. The Chicago Park District began to manage Maplewood Park in 1959. Nearly 30 years later, the Board of Education transferred ownership to the park district, which rehabilitated the park with a new soft surface play area in 1991. "

  "history": "Lincoln Park began as a small public cemetery on the northernmost boundary of Chicago where victims of cholera and small pox were buried in shallow lakeside graves. Aware of the public health threat, citizens began demanding the cemetery's conversion to parkland in the 1850s. In 1860, the city reserved a 60-acre unused section, naming it Lake Park. Shortly after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (1809-65), 16th President of the United States, the park was renamed in his honor. The city allocated $10,000 for improvements, and nurseryman Swain Nelson created and implemented the park's first plan. An early donation of mute swans marked the beginnings of the Lincoln Park Zoo. Citizens argued for the removal of the remaining burial ground. This contributed to a larger parks movement, and in 1869, the state legislature created three park districts: the South, West, and Lincoln Park Commissions, each responsible for the parks and boulevards in its region. Under the direction of the Lincoln Park Commission, bodies were exhumed and relocated to other cemeteries, and the park was expanded south to North Avenue and north to Diversey Parkway. Severe winter storms in 1885 resulted in the construction of a breakwater system which included the first of many landfill projects extending Lincoln Park's boundaries. The independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, and Lincoln Park was expanded north to Foster Avenue. A final expansion in the 1950s brought the park to its current size of 1,208 acres. Throughout Lincoln Park's history, renowned artists, landscape designers, and architects contributed to its development. These included sculptor Augustus-Saint Gaudens, landscape designers Ossian Cole Simonds and Alfred Caldwell, and architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and Dwight H. Perkins. "

  "history": "Transferred by the city to the Chicago Park District in 1959, tiny Mariano Park has borne at least four names since its 1848 donation to the City of Chicago. As early as 1900, the site was known as Green Bay Triangle for the Green Bay Trail that had once run nearby, along the path of what is now Clark Street. In 1931, the City Council designated the park Rehm Arbor, memorializing German immigrant brewer Jacob Rehm (1828-1915), a near north side resident, and variously Lincoln Park Board Commissioner, Chicago police chief, and Cook County Treasurer. Unfortunately, beginning in 1931, a sign mistakenly labelled the park Arbor Rest, the name of another triangular park nearby, for twenty-six years. In 1970, the park district renamed it yet again, this time in honor of another local resident, Louis Mariano (1906-1970). Mariano was a reporter and editor for the Chicago Daily News, and also served as associate editor of the World Book Science Year Book. He organized the annual science fair at nearby Ogden School, the library of which also bears his name. For years Mariano spent his evenings at a restaurant across from the park, holding court and seeking out stories for his North Loop News column. In addition to trees and benches, Mariano Park contains a small fountain and a Prairie-style pavilion designed by Birch Burdette Long in 1900. "

  "history": "Marquette Park pays tribute to Father Jacques Marquette (1637-1675), the famous French Jesuit missionary and explorer. At more than 300 acres in size, it is the largest of the revolutionary neighborhood parks created by the South Park Commission, acquisition began in 1878. Superintendent J. Frank Foster conceived the new parks as beautifully landscaped \"breathing spaces\" that would provide educational and social services to the city's congested immigrant neighborhoods. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers created plans for the entire system of 14 new parks in 1903. The firm's impressive scheme for Marquette Park included a golf course on two islands surrounded by naturalistic lagoons; indoor and outdoor gymnasiums; swimming and wading pools; a children's playground; formal gardens; and a concert grove. Although the first 10 neighborhood parks opened to the public in 1905, due to drainage problems and the site's large size, Marquette Park's improvements occurred slowly, often deviating from the original plan. Two of the park's earliest features were its 18-hole golf course and a nursery of nearly 90,000 trees and shrubs. The commissioners soon began converting existing frame houses and out-buildings on the site to park uses such as a warming shelter for skaters and a small fieldhouse. By 1917, the park included playing fields, a children's playground, tennis courts, propagating houses for the nursery, and a large, classically-designed golf shelter.\u00a0 In 1934, Marquette Park became part of the Chicago Park District when the city's 22 park commissions were consolidated into a single agency.\u00a0 In 1935, the CPD Board of Commissioners authorized the\u00a0reduction of the golf course from 18 holes to 9 holes allowing acreage to be released for the conversion of other recreational facilities.\u00a0 Additionally, through the use of federal relief funds, the park district soon converted the golf shelter into a more substantial fieldhouse, and built comfort stations, and a series of footbridges leading to the islands. Through public subscription in 1935, an Art Deco-style monument commemorating Lithuanian-American aviators Darius and Girenas was installed in Marquette Park. "

An existing brick building was remodeled as a fieldhouse. Following its general practice, the bureau named the park for adjacent Marshfield Avenue. The street apparently takes its name from the marshy territory it traversed before drainage was improved in the late 19th century. In 1959, the city transferred Marshfield Park to the Chicago Park District. In 1966, the park district re-paved and re-planted the park, and added a spray pool and basketball court in following years.

Initially known as West End Playlot for the adjacent street, the park was transferred to the Chicago Park District in 1959. By the late 1980s, the park suffered from crime problems, particularly because an adjacent apartment building had become a crack house. To rid the park of such problems, the park district began working with Bethel New Life, a local civic group and community development organization. Bethel New Life purchased the crack house, evicted the tenants, and transformed the property into much-needed low-income housing. Simultaneously, the park district acquired another half-acre to the north of the park, more than tripling its size. The park district demolished the existing park features, and improved the expanded site following an award-winning design that included a new soft surface play area, a gazebo, an amphitheater, and a computerized interactive waterplay area. Later in 1990, the park district renamed the park in honor of Elizabeth James Mason, a much-loved local resident who served as the area's first African American crossing guard.

  "history": "Created in 1912, Matanky Park, originally known as Morse Park, was the first of four parks created by the Ridge Avenue Park District. The Ridge Avenue district was among 19 neighborhood park commissions established after 1896 to serve areas recently annexed to the city. When Rogers Park residents decided to form a park district in 1895, a bitter fight immediately arose between two local factions. Farmers living in West Rogers Park resented the prospect of being taxed for lake front improvements by east side \"silk stockings.\" The farmers, derisively called \"cabbage heads\" by the east siders, fought to establish their own park district west of the Northwestern Railway line. After a lively campaign rally in which the west siders paraded with cabbages on poles, the farmers won the right to create their own Ridge Avenue Park District. The Ridge Avenue district initially focused on upgrading and maintaining Ridge Avenue, but as its West Rogers Park neighborhood grew, the need for parkland became more pressing. In 1912, the district purchased property at Ridge Avenue and Morse Street, which quickly became known as Morse Park. The new park took its name from the adjacent street, in turn named for Charles H. Morse, an early developer of Rogers Park. In 1984, the Chicago Park District renamed the site Matanky Park for respected local resident Eugene Matanky (1922--1982). Matanky, a newspaperman and real estate developer, was a founder and vice-president of the Jewish Community Council of West Rogers Park, and a member of the Uptown Chicago Commission. "

  "history": "Chicago's West Ridge neighborhood experienced tremendous growth after World War I. Its population ballooned from 7,500 in 1920 to almost 40,000 in 1930. Further growth took place after World War II. In 1946, the Chicago Park District decided to establish a sizable park on Peterson Avenue to meet the area's increasing recreational needs. In 1948, the park district purchased the 8-acre site, initially known as Peterson Park for the adjacent street. A decade passed before improvements began, and the park opened to the public in June of 1959. The park's development coincided with the construction of Mather High School just to the south. From the beginning, the park and the 8-acre school property have been jointly operated by the park district and the Chicago Board of Education. Both the park and the adjacent high school are named for Stephen Tyng Mather (1867-1930), the first Director of the National Park Service. A native Californian, Mather established a borax-making business and soon made his product a household name with the slogan \"20 Mule Team Borax.\" Mather eventually moved to Chicago, where he increased his reputation as an industrialist. Mather joined Chicago's influential Prairie Club and the Friends of the Native Landscape, both of which strongly supported conservation of the Midwest's natural landscape features. During this same period, Mather made frequent trips to the mountains back west, becoming increasingly dismayed at conditions in the national parks. In 1917, Mather was chosen to head the newly-created National Park Service. This position provided a high-profile platform for Mather's advocacy of Midwestern landscape preservation, including a proposal to create a park in the Indiana dunes along Lake Michigan's southern shore.

By 1930, the two-and-a-half acre park included a playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, and a fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld. Having been trained in the office of Chicago architect Julius Huber, Hatzfeld became known for numerous north- and northwest-side park fieldhouses, commercial buildings, and residences. During the Depression, he began working for the Chicago Park District, which formed in 1934 through the consolidation of the city's 22 independent park agencies. As a park district employee, Hatzfeld was responsible for rehabilitating and altering the Mayfair Park Fieldhouse in 1936. This project included enclosing the building's entry loggia to provide more interior space. By 1947, the park district had added more recreational features to Mayfair Park including horseshoe, shuffle board, and tennis courts.

  "history": "California Park, which takes its name from adjacent California Avenue, is one of six parks created by the River Park District. Established in 1917, the district was one of 22 independent park systems consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Northwest Chicago residents formed the River Park District to provide recreational opportunities along the North Branch of the Chicago River and the North Shore Channel and to prevent commercial encroachments there. Soon after its formation, the park district began to purchase more than 13 acres south of Irving Park Road, between California Avenue and the North Shore Channel. Although land acquisition dragged on until 1931, development began in 1920, when Leesely Brothers prepared a landscape plan. Improvements were confined largely to plantings until 1927, when the River Park District began construction of an outdoor swimming pool that was, for a time, Illinois's largest. An athletic field, baseball diamonds, and playgrounds followed in 1928, as did a small brick fieldhouse designed by Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld. In the 1970s, the Chicago Park District demolished the original fieldhouse and erected a new changing facility in its place. The park district also constructed an impressive new indoor sports complex, the first of its kind for the park district. The structure contains a year-round ice rink for figure skating and hockey, as well as six tennis courts. This facility was officially designated the McFetridge Sports Complex in 1974 for William L.

  "history": "In the early 1970s, the Chicago Board of Education decided to expand its Graham Elementary School in the New City neighborhood. The Board of Education built the school addition on nearby Halsted Playlot, a site which had been leased to the Chicago Park District. To compensate for the loss of parkland, the City of Chicago and the Board of Education developed a new park on adjacent property. Equipped with playground equipment and a basketball court, the 1.6-acre site was managed by the park district. The Board of Education retained ownership until 1986, when it was officially transferred to the park district. During the 1990s, the park district acquired another .4 acres from the city for park expansion, soon installing a new soft surface playground. McInerney Park honors Thomas McInerney, one of three brothers who arrived from Ireland in 1870. Three years later, the brothers established an undertaking business at 44th Street and Racine Avenue. Though the partnership was dissolved after several years, Thomas McInerney opened a new funeral home at 4635 South Wallace, two blocks south of the park site. The McInerney family, which runs the business, has been very active in local civic and charitable organizations for many years. "

  "history": "In October of 1901, one month after the assassination of William McKinley, 25th President of the United States, the South Park Commission (SPC) officially named a new and still undeveloped park in his honor. Experimental in its location and intent, this park proved to be nationally important. At the time, Chicago's existing parks were far away from the filthy, noisy, overcrowded tenement neighborhoods in the center of the city. Superintendent J. Frank Foster envisioned a new type of park that would provide social services as well as breathing spaces in these areas. To test the idea, in 1901 the park commission began acquiring property near the Union Stockyards. Composed of open prairie and cabbage patches, the site had previously been the Brighton Park Race Track. The experimental McKinley Park originally offered ballfields, lawn tennis, swimming and wadinglagoon, and a lovely classically-designed bathhouse. More than 10,000 people attended the park's dedication on June 13, 1902. The effort was so successful that the following year the South Park Commission began creating a whole system of new neighborhood parks for the south side. Opened to the public in 1905, the first ten were: Sherman, Ogden, Palmer, Bessemer, and Hamilton Parks, and Mark White, Russell, Davis, Armour, and Cornell Squares. These innovative neighborhood parks influenced the development of other parks throughout the United States. McKinley Park received such intensive use, that in 1906, the SPC acquired adjacent property, doubling its acreage. The designers expanded the existing wading pool into a large naturalistic lagoon with several small wooded islands. They also introduced a children\u2019s playground, a music court plaza, open-air gymnasiums, and the following decade, a field house. "

  "history": "Edgewater's Mellin Park takes its name from Curtis S. Mellin, Sr. (1895--1957), Republican alderman for the surrounding 50th Ward between 1929 and 1931. Mellin lived in the area and was a manager for Goldblatt's Department Store at 4700 North Broadway at the time of his death. It was Mellin who, as alderman, proposed the creation of the park on city land. The city had purchased the half-acre Ashland Avenue property for police department use in 1916. By 1929, the property had become a dumping ground, and Alderman Mellin proposed to convert it to a small park designed especially for the use of mothers with babies and small children. The city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation quickly improved the site, bringing in fresh soil and grading the property; planting trees, shrubs, and grass; and installing benches, a drinking fountain, and a small shelter house and sand box with a trellis-like pergola. Fifteen hundred local residents attended the park's dedication on July 22, 1930. Mellin \"Baby Park,\" the bureau's first park created specifically for young children, proved a success. Three other city parks based on this model (Ashland, Irving Park, and a section of Winnemac) soon followed. In 1959, the city transferred Mellin Park, along with more than 250 other park properties to the Chicago Park District. The park district installed a new soft surface playground there in 1991. "

On June 11, 1949, the city dedicated the site as Memorial Park in honor of the servicemen who fought in World War II. The most destructive war in history, World War II was fought between 1939 and 1945 in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific. Between 35 and 60 million people perished in the war, including 300,000 American servicemen. In 1959, the city transferred ownership of Memorial Park to the Chicago Park District along with more than 250 other city properties. The following year, the park district began working with the city's Urban Renewal Department to enlarge the park. The park district acquired two acres just north and west of Memorial Park in 1966. The expansion project included relocating and upgrading the park's playground, installing basketball courts, and enlarging the athletic field, which allowed for junior league baseball and football instruction and practice. In subsequent years, Memorial Park's fieldhouse and playground were improved and rehabilitated. "

  "history": "Soon after World War II, the Chicago Park District began a major initiative to create new parks for the first time in many years. In 1948, a citizens' advisory committee for new parks recommended a number of potential sites. Among them was a 9-acre picnic and dance ground in the rapidly growing Dunning neighborhood. Known as Kolze's Electric Grove, the site dated to the 1890s, when hotel owner Henry Kolze decided to create an attraction for riders of newly-reaching streetcar lines. Purchasing wooded land near his inn, Kolze strung large gas lamps, offered a nightly orchestra, and beer at a nickel a glass. In 1950, the park district condemned Kolze's Electric Grove, and demolished the site's dance shelter, concession stands, raffle tables, and cafeteria. Retaining many of the older trees, the park district transformed the site into parkland between 1951 and 1956, installing an athletic field, a children's playground, and tennis and basketball courts. At that time, the original clapboard dining hall and tavern structure was converted for use as a fieldhouse. In 1969, the park district replaced the structure with a modern brick fieldhouse. In the early 1950s, when the park district naming committee began its proposal for this site, there was a controversy about whether the Kolze's Grove name should be retained. Although some favored the continuation of the name, an informal park district survey revealed that the old hotel and picnic grove had gained an \"unsavory reputation\" over the years. Merrimac Park was selected as a preferable alternative. Derived from the Native American word for sturgeon, the name Merrimac had become closely associated with this neighborhood. The park was located just west of Merrimac Avenue and the Merrimac Gardens subdivision, and the local community organization was known as the Merrimac Gardens Association. "

One of the proposed sites was within the then overcrowded Lakeview neighborhood on Chicago's north side. Condemning and acquiring less than one fifth of an acre in 1951, the city installed playground equipment, a sandbox, and plantings. The city named the park to honor Theron W. Merryman (1897-1967), who had recently resigned after serving nearly a decade as 45th ward alderman.

  "history": "The Grand Boulevard community, once the center of \"Bronzeville,\" Chicago's thriving African-American neighborhood, became overcrowded between the 1920s and the 1950s, and then fell into decline. The lifting of segregated real estate codes allowed residents to move into other, less crowded neighborhoods, leaving Grand Boulevard with vacant homes and businesses. In the 1960s, the government responded with major urban renewal initiatives, including the construction of the Robert Taylor Homes, 28 high-rise Chicago Housing Authority buildings, one of the nation's most densely-concentrated housing projects. To create recreational opportunities for the increased population, the Chicago Park District began efforts to acquire an old coal yard in 1971. After obtaining Community Block Grant funds, the park district finally acquired the land in 1979. Because it had been used as a dump site for many years, the park district had to undertake an extensive effort to remove garbage and debris, and to demolish the site's existing structures. Finally between 1981 and 1983, the land was transformed into a park with a densely-planted landscape, playground equipment, a spray pool, tennis courts, a shelter building, a little league baseball field, a jogging path, and a picnic area. In 1984, the park district named the site to honor Ralph Metcalfe (1910-1978), an accomplished African-American athlete and politician from Chicago. Metcalfe won silver medals in track and field in the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, and also shared a gold medal with Jesse Owens in the 400-meter relay in 1936. He went on to become the first African-American to serve on the Illinois State Athletic Commission in 1949. After serving as Democratic Committeeman for the 3rd Ward in 1952, Metcalfe was elected as Alderman in 1955 and Congressman for the 1st District in 1970. "

In the early 1970s, as part of a Lincoln Park Urban Renewal Project, the city closed off Sedgwick Street at the park's eastern border, thereby enlarging the small triangle by .4 acres. The Mid-North Association, a Lincoln Park community civic organization, began working with the Chicago Park District in 1991 to rehabilitate the small park. The organization contacted businesses in the community for contributions and found sponsors for personalized bricks to repave the park.

",
  "history": "The Midway Plaisance is a magnificent linear stretch of parkland between Jackson and Washington parks.All three sites were originally conceived as a single landscape known as SouthPark.Soon after the Illinois Legislature established the South Park Commission in 1869 to create and maintain the park, the newly-appointed commissioners hired Olmsted & Vaux, the nationally renowned designers of New York\u2019s Central Park, to lay out the 1055-acre park. Concerned about the flat and marshy conditions of the unimproved site, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. asserted that, \u201cIf a search had been made for the least park-like ground within miles of the city, nothing better meeting the requirement could have been found.\u201d He believed, however, that the site possessed one important asset\u2014 its relationship with Lake Michigan.Interpreting the lake as a tremendous object of sublime scenery, Olmsted & Vaux used water as the guiding theme for the park\u2019s original plan of 1871.. The designers envisioned an intricate system of lushly planted lagoons covering about one-third of the Lower Division (Jackson Park). This waterway would link with Lake Michigan on the east and with a smaller lagoon called the Mere at the Upper Division (Washington Park) on the west via a long formal canal and pleasure drive, accessible to people walking, riding horses (and carriages), and boating.Olmsted & Vaux named the center landscape the Midway Plaisance. (There is a French word plaisance that roughly translates to \u201cplace for boating,\u201d however some dictionaries believe the word is an obsolete spelling of \u201cpleasance,\u201d a secluded part of the landscape or garden.)Despite the importance of the canal to the overall design of the park system, its construction was put on on-hold due to financial problems after the Great Fire of 1871. Two decades later, Jackson Park was selected as the site for the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, and Olmsted worked closely with architect Daniel H. Burnham to transform the largely unfinished grounds into the \u201cWhiteCity.\u201dThe fair authorities decided to use the Midway Plaisance as the site of amusements, restaurants, foreign villages, and ethnological exhibits.These attractions were allowed to charge extra, and helped the fair become a financial success.The most iconic attraction on the Midway was the world\u2019s first Ferris wheel.Standing to a height of 264-feet, it had thirty-six cars, each with a capacity of sixty people.The twenty-minute ride made two revolutions and cost fifty cents per customer (which was the same cost as a full day admission price for the fair.) More than twenty million people had visited the fair during the sixth month period in which it was open in 1893.After it closed, the South Park Commissioners hired Olmsted\u2019s firm, then known as Olmsted, Olmsted, and Eliot, to transform the fairgrounds back into parkland.Emphasizing the great success of the electric launches, gondolas, and other types of boats at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, Olmsted recommended that his vision for a canal through the Midway Plaisance canal should be considered.The commissioners instructed Olmsted to create a revised plan for the canal, and asked him to estimate the expense of the project including the cost of gondolas.They formally adopted Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot\u2019s plan for the Midway Plaisance with the canal in 1894. Although the South Park Commissioners negotiated with the Illinois Central Railroad Company for permission to build part of the canal on railroad right-of-way, the project was delayed again.At the time, transforming the Jackson Park fairgrounds back into usable parkland was the priority, and the canal was proving to be an expensive proposition.In addition to the costs of building the proper crossing over the train tracks and bridges over the water, the project would have also required the construction of a series of locks because of the difference in the elevations of the lagoons, and the fluctuating water levels of Lake Michigan.The canal was considered a future project, and in the meantime, the commissioners installed sewers, drives, walks, bridle paths, reconditioned the wide center lawn, and planted more than 500 elm trees in straight rows lining the driveway. By the turn of the century, the Midway Plaisance was a popular spot for ice skating and sledding in the winter and strolling and bicycle riding in the summer.Architect Henry Ives Cobb had created the original plan for the adjacent University of Chicago campus, and designed some of the institution\u2019s earliest Gothic style buildings.Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg had his track team train for relay races on the Midway. Preeminent sculptor Lorado Taft established his Midway Studio out of a converted barn at 60th Street near Ellis Avenue in 1906.Two years later, he began envisioning ways to beautify the Midway Plaisance.Taft suggested implementing the canal, creating three sculptural bridges to span over it: the Bridge of the Arts, the Bridge of Sciences, and the Bridge of Religions, and lining the waterway with statues of the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest idealists\u201d.At the extreme ends of the broad boulevard Taft suggested two monumental sculptural fountains, the Fountain of Creation on the east end, and the Fountain of Time on the west end. While most of Taft\u2019s proposal was never seriously considered, the B.F. Ferguson Fund of the Art Institute agreed to commission the Fountain of Time in tribute to an 1814 peace treaty between England and the United States.Completed in 1922, the impressive monument was inspired by a poem entitled the Paradox of Time by Henry Austin Dobson.It is composed of a crag-like figure of Father Time watching over a procession of 100 human figures, with a symbolic reflecting pool in between. In the late 1930s, Chicago Park District landscape architect May E. McAdams designed a perennial garden at the east end of the Midway Plaisance which followed the configuration of the circular sunken lawn panel\u2014 the outline of what would have become the canal\u2019s turning basin.McAdams\u2019 garden provided the inspiration for the 2005 Allison Davis Garden designed by landscape architect Peter Lindsay Schaudt and located on the west end of the Midway Plaisance .The new garden pays homage to renowned social anthropologist Allison Davis (1902 \u2013 1983) a pioneering scholar who was the first tenured African-American professor at the University of Chicago. The Chicago Park District and University of Chicago also worked together on the development of new gardens on the north side of the Midway Plaisance, the Winter Garden and the Readers\u2019 Garden. Other recent improvements to the Midway include a rink for ice skating in the winter and in-line skating in the summer. Located in the center of the Midway just west of S. Woodlawn Ave., the rink stands on the exact location of the historic Ferris wheel. The restoration of the Fountain of Time has been one of the most challenging and expensive of the recent improvements in the area.Expert conservator Andrzej Dajnowski began intensive studies to determine the appropriate conservation treatment for the historic concrete fountain in 1992.The $2 million project has been funded by the Chicago Park District, the Ferguson Fund of the Art Institute, a Save America\u2019s Treasures Grant, the University of Chicago, the Parkways Foundation and private donors.Conducted in two major phases between 1998 and 2002 and between 2002 and 2009, sculptural fountain and its reflecting basin have been fully conserved, the surrounding landscape has been improved, and monument\u2019s lighting has been upgraded.

  "history": "Millard Park and the adjacent street take their names from Alden C. Millard, a partner in the real estate firm of Millard and Decker, who subdivided much of the surrounding area in 1870. The firm's \"Lawndale\" development was soon attracting the families of factory workers, especially after the McCormick Reaper Plant relocated nearby in 1871. North Lawndale grew dramatically in the early 20th century, reaching a 1930 population of 112,000, nearly half of whom were Russian Jews. The area's population began to drop somewhat after 1930, but rebounded during the 1950s, as African-Americans moved in to take the place of departing residents. In 1953, the City of Chicago purchased this tenth-acre property on Millard Avenue as part of a city-wide program to develop small parks in under-served neighborhoods like North Lawndale. The Bureau of Parks and Recreation soon developed the site as a playlot, installing basketball courts, playground equipment, and a sandbox. In 1959, the city transferred Millard Park to the Chicago Park District, which rehabilitated the playground area in 1992. "

Beginning in 1829, Miller and Archibald Clybourne ran a ferry across the forks of the Chicago River near Wolf Point. When Cook County was organized in 1831, Miller became one of the first County Commissioners.

  "history": "In the late 1960s, the Chicago Plan Commission identified nine acres of vacant property near Midway Airport for park development. At the time the surrounding Clearing and Garfield Ridge neighborhoods were both experiencing tremendous population growth and a shortage of recreational facilities. The Chicago Park District purchased the property in 1971, using U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds. The following year, the park district improved the site with ball fields and tennis courts. After 1986, a mobile trailer/fieldhouse provided space for indoor activities. (A newer model replaced the original trailer ten years later.) Minuteman Park expanded in 1990, when the park district began leasing six adjacent acres of vacant land from the city. The park's patriotic name was selected in 1976 through a Bicentennial Committee contest conducted in the surrounding 23rd Ward. The minutemen were American colonial militiamen who pledged to take up arms at a minute's notice to aid the cause of Revolution. The first group of minutemen formed in Worcester County, Massachusetts in September, 1774. Similar units were organized in nearby counties in subsequent months. On April 19, 1775, the Battles of Lexington and Concord provided the first test of the minutemen. Seven hundred British troops engaged 77 minutemen on the village green at Lexington, Massachusetts. Unable to hold their ground at Lexington, the colonists turned the tide at the Concord Bridge, where no more than 400 patriots forced the British to withdraw. The American success at Concord prompted the Continental Congress to recommend the formation of minuteman units in other colonies. "

A self-trained architect, Jefferson designed the unusual brick structure himself, expanding and remodeling it throughout his life. By the time the house was essentially complete, it had 35 rooms, none the same shape.

  "history": "Monument Park lies within the former Village of Edison Park, incorporated in 1881. Part of the old Town of Jefferson, the village was organized in an area once known as Canfield, probably for a Chicago & Northwestern Railway platform where local farmers left milk cans for delivery. By 1910, Edison Park's 300 residents, desiring city services, had annexed the village to Chicago. Several years later, the Edison Park Improvement Club led a successful effort to form an independent park board to develop neighborhood parks in the growing community. Monument Park was the first of four parks created by the new Edison Park District. Community residents, polled by mail, selected the one-acre park site just south of the Chicago & Northwestern right-of-way. After purchasing the property in mid-1913, the park district immediately began improving the site with plantings. Initially called Ridge Lawn Park, the site became known as Monument Park after 1918, when residents erected a large memorial \"in Honor of Our Boys Who Served In The Army and Navy of the U.S.A. During the World War.\" The impressive black and white granite pillar still stands, surmounted by a limestone eagle from the old Cook County Courthouse, demolished before 1911. By the time the Edison Park District transferred Monument Park to the Chicago Park District in 1934, the site included symmetrical lawns, walks, trees, and shrubs in addition to the war memorial. The Chicago Park District soon added flowerbeds, a drinking fountain, and benches. Playground equipment installed in 1970 was upgraded 20 years later. "

Two years later, however, the city turned the site over to the Bureau of Parks and Recreation, which established a tree-lined park there in 1929. The new park was well-equipped with an oval wading pool, playground equipment, a small recreational building, and a playfield that was flooded in winter for ice skating. In 1947, the bureau enclosed the open wings of the recreational structure, creating a year-round facility. The Chicago Park District began managing this Board of Education-owned property in 1959.

  "history": "Mount Greenwood Park takes its name from the surrounding community. In 1879, George Waite obtained a state charter to develop a large cemetery on a low ridge west of 111th Street. The ridge, covered with oaks, hickory, aspen, and other trees, inspired the moniker Mount Greenwood. As a steady stream of visitors came to the beautiful cemetery, inns, restaurants, and shops soon opened nearby, forming the basis for the new Mount Greenwood community. Incorporated as a village in 1907, Mount Greenwood was annexed to Chicago twenty years later. The neighborhood had few modern services until 1936, when the Federal Works Progress Administration installed sewers and street lights, and paved the streets. With these improvements, Mount Greenwood's population soared, nearly tripling between 1940 and 1950. The booming Mount Greenwood community was among the neighborhoods identified for park development in the Chicago Park District's Ten Year Plan to provide increased recreational opportunities in post-World War II Chicago. In 1946, the Mount Greenwood Civic Council urged the acquisition of vacant Board of Education land along 111th Street. The park district purchased the 24-acre site in 1949, and slowly began improving the property. The park district constructed a fieldhouse in 1966, and added a swimming pool in 1973. The 1990s brought further improvements such as refrigerated ice skating rink provides winter recreation. Several features of Mount Greenwood Park honor noted local citizens. A parking area is dedicated to Frederick G. Abrams, Sr. a Chicago Alderman and Treasurer of the Village of Mount Greenwood from 1918 to 1927. A baseball diamond bears the name Rooney Field, in honor of Rooney Richardson, who took an active role in community affairs. The Chicago Park District and Mount Greenwood Advisory Council worked with elected officials to raise $1.2 million for a fullyaccessible soft surface playground dedicated in 2008. The playground includes interactive art components which were designed by local artists through the Chicago Public Art Group. Community workshops inspired the artworks which range from a series of mosaic obelisks to metal sculptural musical elements. "

In 1945, the Morgan Park Manor Improvement Association transferred property straddling the Baltimore & Ohio C.T. Railroad right-of-way to the city. The Bureau of Parks and Recreation began improving the land west of the tracks in 1948, and within two years, the new park had playing fields, playground apparatus, and a small recreation building. Tennis courts were added east of the tracks in 1955. In 1959, the city transferred a portion of the park to the Chicago Park District. The remaining property was transfered two years later. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the park district substantially improved the park with a soft surface playground, a sand volleyball court, a soccer field, and a fitness course. \u00a0To meet the changing needs of the community, the Chicago Park District converted the underutilized tennis courts into a junior artificial turf baseball field in 2010. Initially known as Talman Playground for a nearby street, the property had been renamed Munroe Park by 1955. The derivation of the park's name is unknown.   "

  "history": "On June 4, 1917, the City of Chicago purchased land in the West Englewood community to construct a section of the Southwest Water Tunnel. Nearly a decade later, the city gave the Bureau of Parks and Recreation permission to develop the property as parkland. Established in 1929, the new park was well-equipped with playground apparatus, boys' and girls' playfields and a separate baseball field, an oval wading pool bordered by a wooden pergola, and a small recreation building with open shelter and sand court wings. The open wings of the recreation structure were enclosed in 1947 to create a year-round facility. In 1959, the city began leasing property to the Chicago Park District, which installed new basketball courts and plantings in 1966 and rehabilitated the playground area twenty years later. This site has been known as Murray Park since 1928. Until 1930, the park was officially, but incorrectly, designated Daniel L. Murray Park. The park was in fact meant to honor David L. Murray (1865-1955), a local educator. Born in Ontario, Canada, in 1865, Murray worked for the Chicago school board for 54 years. For many years, he taught at Raster Elementary School, located just three blocks from the park, at 6900 South Hermitage Avenue. He also served as the school's principal. A resident of West Englewood, Murray lived at 6733 South Marshfield Avenue. "

The park has been known as Myrtle Grove since at least 1916, apparently for Myrtle Avenue (now known as Northcott), the park's northern boundary. It is puzzling that the Myrtle Avenue was so named, since the myrtle does not grow in the Chicago region. The ancient Romans held the myrtle, an evergreen, in high regard. They recognized two species, the Patrician and the Plebian. According to Roman legend, the political fortunes of the nobles and the commoners could be judged based on which of the two trees flourished and which languished. "

At the time, the surrounding South Shore community suffered from a severe shortage of recreational facilities. The area parks included neither gymnasiums nor swimming pools. The former YMCA offered both a central location in the community and approximately 35,000 square feet of space, nearly twice that of the average modern Chicago park fieldhouse. After purchasing the property, the park district extensively remodeled the building, which had been constructed by the YMCA in the 1940s. Using funds from the Government Assistance Project of the Chicago Community Trust, the park district also developed wide-ranging programming for the site. Today, Don Nash Community Center, with its gymnasium, swimming pool, kitchen, and club rooms, is popular gathering place for South Shore residents. Donald Jordan Nash (1935-1992), for whom the park is named, joined the Coca Cola Company in 1962 as a route helper, rising through the ranks to become the company's first African-American to serve as Vice President of Community and Governmental Affairs. A native Chicagoan, Nash demonstrated a great commitment to children in Chicago Park District programs, volunteering as a mentor and teacher in his spare time. "

  "history": "In 1963, the Chicago Park district acquired more than six acres of land in the deteriorating Hyde Park neighborhood from the city's Department of Urban Renewal. The park district soon improved the site with a reflecting pool, tennis courts, walkways, and asphalt-surfaced play areas for tots and older children. In 1970, Italian-American artist Cosmo Campoli created a fanciful bronze sculpture called \"Bird of Peace\" which enlivens the park's central lawn. Though the park district expanded the park a bit during the following decade, several acres of cleared land immediately to the south remained undeveloped for years. In the mid-1980s, the Hyde Park Development Corporation recommended that the vacant property be used for stores and upscale townhouses. Many neighborhood residents instead favored expanding Nichols Park. After lobbying for the project for several years, the community convinced the City Council to approve the expansion. The park district's 1991 acquisition of the property brought Nichols Park to more than ten acres, and the new park land soon had a formal garden, a fountain, and a grassy courtyard. The park honors artist and urban planner John Fountain Nichols (1912-1980), a life-long resident of Hyde Park. A student of the Art Institute of Chicago, Nichols participated in the Federal Artists' Project during the Great Depression. (One of his many murals can be found at the north side Lane Technical High School.) After returning to his studies and earning a BFA during World War II, he taught art in south side public schools, later becoming an architectural draftsman. During the 1950s and 1960s, Nichols worked for the Department of Urban Renewal, developing plans to rehabilitate his Hyde Park neighborhood. After his retirement in the 1970s, Nichols continued to participate in arts-related events at Murray School, which sits adjacent to the park. "

  "history": "The North Park Village Nature Center is often described as a hidden gem in the city. But this site was well known to generations before us, and clues to how people used the land can be found here. During pre-settlement times, the wild onion and wild leek growing in wet woods here inspired Native Americans to name area the \u201cland of the stinking onion\u201d which was translated to \u201cChicago\u201d by European settlers. In the early 1800s, farmers drained the wet areas to plant crops. And in the mid-1850s, a Norwegian immigrant Pehr Samuel Petersen purchased the land and established a tree nursery here. The very successful Mr. Peterson provided trees and shrubs for the World\u2019s Fair in 1893, many of the trees historically planted in Lincoln Park and a large number of all the trees planted in Chicago\u2019s parkways and boulevards by 1910. During the early 20th century, as increasing numbers of Chicagoans were contracting Tuberculosis, local officials decided to establish a sanitarium at the outskirts of the city where patients could live and receive treatment in a country-like setting.\u00a0 After the passage of the State and City Sanitarium Acts of 1909, a 160-acre plot of previous nursery land and some adjacent farmland at Bryn Mawr and Pulaski avenues was selected as the site for the sanitarium. The Sanitarium\u2019s Board of Directors hired landscape architect Ossian Cole Simonds (1855 \u2013 1931) and architects Clark & Otis to design and layout the facility.\u00a0 Portions of the land were changed into paths, gardens for growing food, fields to play and a pond for recreation. Clark & Otis designed a small brick cottage like structure that would become the Nature Center.\u00a0 This originally served the Sanitarium\u2019s dispensary, where certain patients could come to get their medications. Patients were here from 1915 when Chicago\u2019s Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium first opened until the mid 1970s, when facility closed after TB had been largely eradicated. In the late 1970s, developers planned to raze the buildings and landscape and convert build commercial property here. However, community activists rallied against these plans, ushering in the creation of North Park Village and preservation of the buildings and landscape. In 1989, an easement was enacted to prohibit any development of this property and to define how it was to be maintained as a natural area for 75 years. Efforts are being made by today\u2019s community activists to extend this protection into perpetuity. Now, in a short stroll, visitors can experience a forest, a prairie, wetland and oak savanna. And in the 1980s, a sweet new tradition was begun: the Maple Syrup Festival, which taps into the very trees that Pehr Peterson planted more than a century ago. Eventually, programming and visits to the Nature Center grew with additional events such as the Harvest Festival, Winter Solstice, and City Wilds Fest. On April 1, 2004 the Nature Center became part of the Chicago Park District. Whether you seek serenity, a place to spot a rare bird, or a place to volunteer your time and talent, visit this oasis of nature in the city \u2013 this hidden gem. "

  "history": "Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham imagined Northerly Island as one of the northernmost points in a series of manmade islands stretching between Grant and Jackson Parks. His vision for this park included lagoons, harbors, beaches, recreation areas, a scenic drive and grand stretches of green space that would provide breathtaking views of the lake and City skyline. Northerly Island and Burnham Park were selected as the site of Chicago's second World's Fair entitled A Century of Progress, 1933-34, and by the early 1930s, Northerly Island had been increased to its present size. In 1938, the Chicago Park District removed the bridge leading to Northerly Island and built a causeway connecting the island to Burnham Park. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Northerly Island featured paths and walkways, scattered trees and grass, a parking lot and the 12th Street Beach. In 1947, a small airport known as Meigs Field opened under the Exposition Authority Act. Operations at Meigs expanded with the building of an air control tower in 1952. The 50-year lease granted by the park district for Meigs Field expired on September 30, 1996. The City, Park District, and numerous civic organizations agreed that the airport should revert to parkland. Today, Daniel Burnham\u2019s vision is now a reality.

The developers named their village for the 1867 novel Norwood, written by clergyman and abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887). When local development surged after the Fire, a 3-acre triangular site along Circle Avenue was set aside as parkland. Twenty years later, the City of Chicago annexed the village and took control of Norwood Circle Park. By 1909, the wooded triangle was the responsibility of the city's Special Parks Commission. The city transferred Norwood Circle Park to the Chicago Park District in 1959. "

  "history": "Norwood Park, located in the community area of the same name, dates to the 1920s. Thirty years earlier, the City of Chicago had annexed Norwood Park Village, already a community of substantial homes. When residential development surged after 1910, citizens created a local park district to serve the area. Established in 1920, the Norwood Park District was one of 22 park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. The Norwood Park District purchased 14 acres for its first park in 1921. Site drainage began in 1922, and bath house and swimming pool construction shortly thereafter. In 1928, the park district added a fieldhouse with a 500-seat assembly hall. The community, the park district, and the park itself all take their names from Norwood, an 1867 novel by clergyman and abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887). The moniker \"Park\" was added to the community name because Norwood was already the name of an Illinois post office. "

  "history": "O'Hallaren Park, in the south side Auburn Gresham neighborhood, is one of many city parks created to meet the recreational needs of post-World War II Chicago. After leasing land from the Board of Education in 1946, the city began improving the site with a small recreational building, a multi-purpose athletic field that could be flooded for ice skating in winter, and a playground with separate areas for boys, girls, and small children. On December 22, 1947, the city officially named the site O'Hallaren Park, in honor of 18th Ward Alderman Bernard J. O'Hallaren (--1947), who had died suddenly the previous week. Elected alderman in 1939, O'Hallaren had been an enthusiastic and untiring supporter of the park, dying just a few months short of its completion. In 1959, the city transferred management of O'Hallaren Park to the Chicago Park District, which added basketball and volleyball courts in 1966 and a spray pool and tennis courts in the early 1980s. Within a few years of rehabilitating and replanting the playground area in 1988, the park district acquired formal ownership of the park from the Board of Education. "

  "history": "Oakdale Park takes its name from the surrounding neighborhood within Chicago's Washington Heights community. In the 19th century, oak groves stood throughout the area, inspiring the name Oakdale. The Oakdale neighborhood developed east of Halsted Street before World War II. When construction of single-family homes began west of Halsted during the war, the Oakdale name was applied to this area as well. At the close of the World War II, the Chicago Park District initiated a Ten Year Plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served and rapidly-growing areas of the city. Among the neighborhoods identified for park development was Oakdale, where housing construction was rapidly depleting vacant land. The park district purchased the 9.5-acre park site in 1947, and soon developed plans for the park. Park improvements were slow to materialize, however, due to the flurry of construction at other parks throughout the city. By 1955, Oakdale Park had an athletic field, playground equipment, and a comfort station, which was improved and expanded in 1959. During the 1960s, the park district asked local residents to choose between further expansion of the recreational building and a new swimming pool. Residents opted for the pool, constructed in 1969. A soft surface playground area and ornamental fencing were added in the 1990s. "

  "history": "Named for William B. Ogden (1805-1877), Chicago's first mayor, Ogden Park opened to the public in 1905. The site was one of ten revolutionary parks created to provide relief to Chicago's overcrowded tenement districts. The other nine were Sherman, Palmer, and Hamilton Parks and Armour, Russell, Davis, Cornell, and Mark White Squares. (Mark White Square is now known as McGuane Park.) Offering a variety of valuable recreational, educational, and social services to their surrounding communities, these ten properties soon influenced the development of other parks throughout the nation. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. created a unique design for each park. Ogden, however, shared traits with Sherman Park in terms of both size and design. Each site was 60 acres in size. Additionally, each had a beautiful landscape with a meandering waterway near a meadow of ballfields. Ogden Park's waterway was drained and filled in 1940. The classically-designed fieldhouse underwent a major remodeling in 1972. In 1998, the Chicago Park District created a major regional playground in Ogden Park. One of the city's most exciting places for children, the Ogden Park playground includes assembly and stage areas, play equipment, an interactive water feature, and a canopied carousel. "

Just two years later, the 4,000 inhabitants of the newly-incorporated city elected him mayor. After bringing Chicago safely through the Panic of 1837, Ogden went on to make his fortune in real estate. Ogden reinvested his profits in the burgeoning city, investing in its first railroad, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (later acquired by another Ogden rail line, the Chicago and Northwestern), constructing bridges and streets, and donating land for churches and schools. In 1857, Ogden was among the founders of the Chicago Dock and Canal Company, established to develop land on the north bank of the Chicago River for industrial purposes. A young Abraham Lincoln provided legal counsel to the fledgling company.In the mid-1980s, real estate developers began planning a mixed-used development, Cityfront Center, on land owned by Chicago Dock and Canal Trust, a successor to Ogden's firm. In 1988, Chicago Dock and Canal Trust donated slightly more than an acre of property to the Chicago Park District for recreational development at Cityfront Center. Designed by Lohan Associates in 1990, Ogden Plaza Park a multi-leveled plaza studded with trees and benches.

During the 1910s and 1920s, the population of the surrounding Edison Park neighborhood increased from 300 to over 5,000 residents, although stretches of farmland still separated the fine homes. Local residents established the Edison Park District in 1913 to provide recreational opportunities for the developing community. Twelve years later, the Edison Park District purchased a 10-acre tract of open land to create a much-anticipated athletic field. The local athletic association pushed for rapid improvements, even offering to help with fund-raising efforts. The park district quickly responded by grading the site, laying out a baseball field, and erecting a grandstand. In 1934, the Great Depression forced consolidation of Chicago's 22 independent park boards into the unified Chicago Park District. By 1940, the Chicago Park District had improved Olympia Park with a children's playground, tennis courts, and an athletic field that was flooded for ice skating in winter. The park also became known for its 14 beautiful flower beds. During the 1950s, the Chicago Park District constructed a small recreation building in the park. This was remodeled and expanded around 1970.

  "history": "Oriole Park takes its name from the surrounding subdivision in the Norwood Park community. As late as 1930, it was a sparsely-settled, semi-rural area. Lying a mile from the Northwestern Railway's Norwood Park station, the neighborhood began to fill with single-family homes in the 1920s, when newly-affordable automobiles allowed middle-class families to move further out. Oriole Park was created by the Edison Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Several years before the consolidation, a committee of the 77th Avenue Improvement Club urged the Edison Park District to create a playground along Oriole Avenue. The local park district purchased the land in mid-1931. By late the following year, the city had vacated an adjacent alley, bringing the park to 2.29 acres. The Edison Park District considered constructing a softball field on the property, but made few improvements to the swampy site. Still, local children used the new park enough to prompt a neighboring farmer to ask that a fence be erected to prevent stray baseballs from ruining his crops. Not long after the 1934 transfer to the Chicago Park District, a softball diamond and a playground were installed at Oriole Park. After World War II, the park district added more than 16 acres to the park in anticipation of increased population expected because of construction of the Northwest Highway. For a time, the park district and the Chicago Board of Education provided joint programming at the park and the adjacent Oriole Park School. This co-operative relationship ended in the early 1970s, when a large fieldhouse was constructed in the park. During the 1990s, the park received a new soft surface playground and an interactive waterplay area. "

  "history": "The 1869 creation of Chicago's West Park System spurred rapid development in the Humboldt Park community. Only two years later, industry moved west from the city due to the devastation caused by the Great Chicago Fire. New Chicago and North Western Railroad car shops soon covered the southwestern corner of the Humboldt Park community, and railroad workers built inexpensive homes nearby. A century later, the economic importance of the railroad had faded, and the surrounding area was suffering decline. In 1971, the Chicago Park District teamed with the Board of Education and the Public Building Commission to create a new school/park complex. The office of Mies Van Der Rohe, architect of Chicago's IBM Building and Illinois Center, was commissioned to design the new high school and adjacent recreational building. The park district soon improved the surrounding property with basketball and tennis courts, a straight-away running track, and facilities for various track and field events. Although the park district transferred ownership of the property to the Board of Education in 1991, the agencies have continued joint operations at the site ever since. Both Orr Park and the adjacent high school honor Rezin Orr, founder of a railway employees union that served the neighborhood's early residents.

Burroughs suggested that the park be renamed in honor of world-renowned athlete Jesse Owens (1913-1980). Owens, an African-American, was born in Danville, Alabama in 1913 and attended Ohio State University, where he was an All-American in track and field.

Owens won much recognition for his athletic prowess. The Associated Press acclaimed him the \"Athlete of the Half Century\" in 1950, and President Ford awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976.

The urban renewal plan identified a 13-acre site for a new park, and in 1974, the Chicago Park District acquired the land.

Baum settled in Chicago in 1891 several miles west of what is now the park. Having begun writing children's books at age 41, Baum wrote more than 60 books, including 14 Oz books, by the end of his life. In 1939, the production of an MGM movie, The Wizard of Oz, immortalized Baum's classic work of fiction.\u00a0In the early 1990s, the Oz Park Advisory Council and the Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce commissioned artist John Kearney to create a Tin Man sculpture, installed in October 1995.\u00a0 The Advisory Council followed up by raising funds for the Cowardly Lion, installed in May 2001; the 7 ft./800 lb. cast bronze Scarecrow, installed June 2005 and in Spring 2007 Dorothy & Toto joined their friends in the park.

New City was for many years a center of meat packing, long among Chicago's most widely-recognized and influential industries. The enormous Union Stock Yards opened south of Pershing Road and west of Halsted Street on Christmas Day, 1865. The development of the refrigerated rail car in the 1870s prompted exponential growth in the industry. By 1884, more than 30 large packing houses had been established to the west of the yards. Well into the 20th century, immigrants arriving in Chicago found jobs in the slaughter houses and packing plants and took up residence in the surrounding community. Known as Packingtown, the area received notoriety through Upton Sinclair's 1905 novel, The Jungle. The Chicago packing industry began its slide into decline in the 1920s.

The park has four nodes based on the book by Margery Williams and a rabbit trail linking the nodes together.   ",
  "history": "A seven-acre rectangular swath of green space, Palmer Square was created as part of Chicago\u2019s historic boulevard system in the early 1870s. The West Park Commissioners originally called the site Palmer Place, renaming it Palmer Square by ordinance in 1909. The name honors John McAuley Palmer (1817 \u2013 1900), a lawyer and Civil War General who served as the 15th Governor of Illinois, and as a United States Senator. As elegant residences began developing along Palmer Square and Humboldt Boulevard between the 1880s and early 1900s, Chicagoans often used the thoroughfares for strolling, carriage rides, and cycling. At the time, a bicycle craze swept through Chicago, largely spurred by the recent invention of the safety bike. Palmer Square became a popular spot for \u201cwheelmen,\u201d local clubs, and even national biking organizations. Biking enthusiasts used the ovular paved road surrounding the parkland as a track, sometimes even sharing it with pedestrians who occasionally objected to these \u201cscorchers\u201d taking over the roads. Because of its boulevard connection with Humboldt Park, Palmer Square was also used in city-wide bike routes, races, and parades. These events, ranging from two to 25 miles, were extremely popular with clubs across the city. In one particularly descriptive Chicago Tribune article, dated May 25, 1896, the writer calls the Associated Cycling Clubs Annual Run \u2013 where clubs chose specific colors and patterns as riding emblems - a \u201ckaleidoscope of color.\u201d This trend is especially interesting considering that Ignaz Schwinn (1860 - 1948), founder of Schwinn Bicycles, lived at the corner of W. Palmer St. and N. Humboldt Blvd. during the 1910s. Chicago\u2019s West Park System managed Palmer Square until 1934, when all of the city\u2019s independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. As part of the Functional Consolidation Act of 1958, the City of Chicago assumed ownership of the property. In recent years, City and Park District officials determined that the surrounding Logan Square neighborhood suffered from a deficit in recreational facilities. Using funds from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Chicago Park District made improvements to Palmer Square in 2008. This included upgrading the running track that circles around the edges of the green space and creating a custom-designed playground for younger children that was inspired by the famous book The Velveteen Rabbit. The City of Chicago transferred Palmer Square back to the Chicago Park District in 2013. "

  "history": "Palmer Park was named for Potter Palmer (1826-1902), one of Chicago's most successful merchants. Palmer opened a dry goods store in 1852, which became known for remarkable customer service practices. Several years later, he sold the business to Marshall Field and Levi Z. Leiter. In the late 1860s, Palmer began buying property on State Street. Although Lake Street was then the city's commercial center, Palmer successfully shifted this activity to State Street, developing it as the city's major retail thoroughfare. Palmer was a member of the South Park Commission and vice-president and director of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The South Park Commission acquired Palmer Park in 1904 as part of its innovative neighborhood park system. Conceived by superintendent J. Frank Foster, this system was based on a new type of park providing social services as well as breathing spaces to the city's congested tenement districts. The Olmsted Brothers landscape architects and D.H. Burnham and Co. architects designed the first ten neighborhood parks, which all opened in 1905. In addition to Palmer Park, these were Ogden, Sherman, Bessemer, and Hamilton Parks, and Mark White, Russell, Davis, Armour, Cornell Squares. Palmer Park became part of the Chicago Park District in 1934, when the city's 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into a new unified system. Later that year, park district art director James Edward McBurney created three murals for Palmer Park as a Works Progress Administration project funded by the federal government. The three are: \"Native Americans,\" \"explorers,\" and \"Dutch settlers.\" McBurney painted other notable Chicago murals at Wentworth School, Tilden High School, and Woodlawn National Bank. "

  "description": "Palmisano Park, formerly known as Stearns Quarry, \u00a0is a 26.60-acre site on Chicago\u2019s southwest side\u00a0in the heart of the Bridgeport community. Its story is one of transformation, as it has changed from coral reefs to quarry to landfill to park. Not surprisingly, each incarnation played a major role in developing the next. Take the Palmisano Park Audio Tour This is a dynamic park, with a fishing pond, interpretive wetlands, preserved quarry walls, trails, an athletic field, a running track, and a hill that offers dramatic views. Over 1.7 miles of paths, including recycled timber boardwalks, concrete walks, a crushed stone running path, and metal grating walkways traverse the park. These trails allow for a variety of experiences along the quarry wall, across the terracing wetlands, and down to the pond. Scenic overlooks provide dramatic overviews of the pond and wetlands, and spectacular city views can be seen from the mound. While there is no structured programming taking place at this location, we invite you to check out our great programs offered at nearby McGuane Park. ",
  "history": "In 2009, this park was one of Chicago's newest and most interesting green spaces, opened in the Bridgeport neighborhood. After convening community meetings to determine the needs of local residents, the Chicago Park District hired Site Design Group to develop a plan for the park. The environmentally-sustainable design was inspired by the natural history of the site. This is the site of an ancient coral reef dating back to the Silurian age 400 million years ago. Dolomite limestone formed, and fossils that were found here are now in the collections of several area museums including Field Museum of Natural History. In the late 1830s, the land was purchased by the Illinois Stone and Lime Company which began quarry operations. Within a short time, one of its partners, Marcus Cicero Stearns took over and renamed the quarry. Stearns was an early Chicago settler who got his start by opening a supply store for workmen who blasted out rock to build the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Even after Stearns died in 1890, the quarry continued operating under his name until 1970. For the next few decades, the site was used as a landfill for clean construction debris. After the dumping ended, the idea of transforming the site into a new park emerged. The new park would be especially important because the surrounding Bridgeport neighborhood had long suffered from a lack of adequate green space. Today, visitors to Palmisano Park can go fishing in a pond that retains old quarry walls; stroll along a wetland area that drains into the pond; watch for birds and other wildlife attracted by the site's vast range of native plants; fly kites in an open meadow; or take in the views of the cityscape. Chicago Park District Project Manager Claudine Malik explains: \u201cThe Stearns Quarry of today has certainly come a long way from the days of a limestone quarry. The vibrant, active park is a welcome respite from city life, an educational opportunity, a place for recreation and a prime example of what creative thinking can accomplish and yet the memory of the quarry and its lasting historic legacy remain inextricably a part of the park.\u201d "

  "history": "\u201cMajor\u201d Taylor Trail History Created along an old rail line in the late 1990s, the \u201cMajor\u201d Taylor Trail is a bicycle and pedestrian link between the Dan Ryan Woods in Chicago and Whistler Woods in Riverdale. In 2006, the Chicago Park District entered into a lease agreement with the Chicago Department of Transportation to manage and maintain the site. The trail honors Marshall W. \u201cMajor\u201d Taylor (1878 \u2013 1932) who was one of the most celebrated bicycle racers of the late nineteenth century. The son of an African American Civil War veteran, Marshall Taylor was born in rural Indiana. He moved with his family to Indianapolis, where his father, Gilbert Taylor found work as a coachman for a wealthy white family, the Southards, who gave Marshall his first bicycle when he was around twelve years old. Marshall became such a good cyclist that he was hired by a local bicycle store owner to perform stunts outside of his shop. Because the owner had Marshall wear a soldier\u2019s uniform while performing his popular bicycle stunts, he became known as \u201cMajor\u201d Taylor. In 1891, at the age of 13, he entered his first race as a joke. Taylor won this race, which was held in Indianapolis. According to his obituary in the Chicago Tribune, Taylor \u201cstartled the city with his rare performance and soon became the big drawing card at bicycle races,\u201d throughout the nation. He moved to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1895, and continued setting new records at races. By 1899, Taylor held seven world records, but because of racial prejudice, he was not given the opportunity to compete in a national championship until 1900, when he won the American Spirit competition. Over the next several years, he competed in and won races in Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. He retired from racing at the age of 32 in 1910. Taylor published his autobiography entitled The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the World in 1928. After encountering years of financial and health problems, he returned to Chicago in 1930. Two years later he died in the charity ward of Cook County Hospital. A group of bicycle enthusiasts, including Frank Schwinn donated money to purchase a proper gravesite for Taylor. In 1948, they had \u201cMajor\u201d Taylor\u2019s remains exhumed and reburied to his new gravesite in a Mt. Glenwood, Illinois cemetery. "

In 1979, the park district honored a request from 43rd Ward Alderman Martin J.

In 1913, the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad adopted the Park View name for its new commuter station. As the neighborhood continued to develop through the 1920s, many of its organizations and businesses also took the name. In 1943, the City of Chicago began creating a new park for the Park View neighborhood. Five years later, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation installed a sand box, a small brick recreation building, and a playing field that could be flooded for ice skating in winter. In 1959, the city transferred Park-View Park to the Chicago Park District along with more than 250 other properties. Having upgraded the site numerous times, the park district recently installed separate play equipment for younger and older children and enclosed the playground area with new iron fencing. "

The park district acquired most of the park property in 1948, as part of a ten-year plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served neighborhoods in post-World War II Chicago. At the time, the southwestern section of the West Elsdon community was experiencing substantial residential growth. When the city vacated a portion of South Kolin Street and adjacent alleys in 1953, the park expanded by several acres. Within the next few years, the park district installed playground equipment and constructed a comfort station with an office and game room. The park district rehabilitated the playground in 1996. Pasteur Park and the adjacent school bear the name of chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895). A native of Dole, France, Pasteur is recognized as the founder of the microbiological sciences. Pasteur postulated that microscopic organisms, which he called germs, caused both spoilage in food and disease in humans. Following up on his theories through experimentation, he developed pasteurization, a heat treatment that destroys micro-organisms in food and other perishable items. His experiments also led to vaccines for various life-threatening diseases, including rabies. "

  "history": "The Chicago Park District transformed this once-vacant lot to parkland in 1969, and officially named it Buckthorn Park in 1974. The park was one of a number of properties named for trees and plants at this time. There are roughly 100 species of buckthorns, comprising both trees and shrubs. All are small in size, with spiny branches and fruit that resembles small berries. The berries are eaten by birds, thus dispersing the seeds. In April of 2015, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners renamed Buckthorn Park in honor of Hadiya Pendleton. At the time, plans were underway to expand the small playlot from less than a quarter acre in size to a 2 acre park. The Chicago Park District hired Planning Resources Inc. to design the enlarged park in a manner that honor the cultural heritage of Bronzeville and pay tribute to the park\u2019s namesake. Plans included a new playground, interactive water feature, a walking path, and fitness stations. Many of the park's features such as a \u201cmusical staff path,\u201d sculptural seating to emulate books and musical instruments, and inscriptions in planters and knee walls\u00a0symbolize Bronzeville\u2019s cultural heritage. The new park is considered a fitting tribute to Chicagoan Hadiya Pendleton (1997 \u2013 2013). An honor student at King College Prep High School, Hadiya Pendleton was killed as the result of a senseless act of violence. While sitting under a shelter in nearby Vivian Gordon Harsh Park in January of 2013, Hadyia and her friends came under fire by gang members who had mistaken them as rivals. Only a few weeks earlier, Hadiya had performed as a drum majorette in President Obama\u2019s second inauguration. Hadiya\u2019s murder has brought national attention to the widespread gun violence plaguing communities throughout America. Her parents Nathaniel and Cleopatra Pendleton attended President Obama\u2019s State of the Union Address in which he spoke passionately about the need for gun control. Michelle Obama has also made powerful speeches in which Hadiya served as an important symbol for the need to stop this violence. In a speech to students at Chicago\u2019s Harper High School, the First Lady implored the audience to consider Hadiya a role model. She urged them to use their own lives to give meaning to Hadiya\u2019s life. "

  "history": "Peterson Park honors Pehr Samuel Peterson (1830-1903), a pioneer nurseryman and early inhabitant of the Swedish community known as Peterson Woods, in what is now the North Park neighborhood. Arriving in the United States in 1850, Peterson came west to Chicago four years later and started a landscape nursery northwest of the city, eventually acquiring over 500 acres of land. Peterson developed an innovative technique for transplanting large trees from his nursery. Peterson's trees soon shaded many Chicago parks and boulevards, including Jackson Park, which was made lush and green for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Peterson also was active in Swedish-American civic and religious groups. The King of Sweden knighted him for his accomplishments. Several years after Peterson's death in 1903, his family donated 160 acres of land to the City of Chicago for a municipal tuberculosis sanitarium. When the sanitarium opened in 1915, TB was the Western World's leading killer, but by mid-century, improved public hygiene and the advent of vaccines and antimicrobial drugs had drastically reduced the incidence of the disease. In the 1970s, the city decided to redevelop the under-used sanitarium property as North Park Village, a campus for city programs and social services. The redevelopment plan called for transforming the original hospital and grounds into senior citizen housing, a school for the developmentally disabled, and a wooded, 46-acre natural area. In addition, nearly 24 acres were developed as parkland. The Chicago Park District began leasing the site in 1977, and soon improved it with playgrounds, basketball and volleyball courts, and athletic fields. An existing building provided space for indoor recreation. Improvements made in the 1990s included the addition of two soft surface playgrounds and the creation of a gymnastics center in another of the old sanitarium buildings. "

Pietrowski Park is one of three Chicago parks named in honor of a group of firemen who perished in a disaster fire on March 1, 1957. Fireman Second Class Sylvester L.

  "history": "Pleasant Point Park was created by the Norwood Park District, one of 22 park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Immediately after its establishment in 1920, the Norwood Park District developed the first of its parks, 14-acre NorwoodPark. In 1926, the Pleasant Point Improvement Association called for additional recreational facilities in the neighborhood. Four years later, the park district selected a new park site, but residents balked at the property's high cost. Shortly thereafter, the park district chose the present site. The landscape was immediately improved and fitted with playground equipment. In 1932, the park district erected a shelter house and tennis courts. For years, the park was commonly known as Norwood Playground despite its proximity to the much larger Norwood Park. In 1999, to avoid further confusion, the Chicago Park District officially designated the park Pleasant Point after its original promoters. "

The park was one of a number of park district properties named for trees and plants at this time. Poplar trees are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in the temperate zone. In North America, trees known as cottonwood, quaking aspen, and poplar are all poplar species. Poplars can reach heights of 40 to 100 feet. Hardy and fast-growing though short-lived, they are often planted as windbreaks. In the natural landscape, poplars provide winter and spring diets for many animals. Moose and deer eat the twigs and leaves. Beavers and hares consume bark, leaves, and buds. Birds dine on buds and young flower stalks or catkins. "

  "history": "Portage Park was created in 1913 by the Old Portage Park District, an independent park board formed by local citizens to enhance property values and improve their northwest side neighborhood. The name of the new park district, and that of its first and largest park, makes reference to several nearby routes used by Native Americans and fur traders to portage their canoes between the DesPlaines and Chicago Rivers. The American Park Builders Company prepared the original plan for Portage Park and completed initial construction between 1913 and 1917. The park design included a naturalistic swimming lagoon, which opened to the public in July, 1916. By the 1920s, the new park was thriving. Noted architect Clarence Hatzfeld designed a handsome prairie-style fieldhouse in 1922, followed by an attractive brick gymnasium in 1928. Portage Park quickly became the center of the community, providing athletics and team sports, cultural and club activities, festivities and special events. In 1934, the city's 22 independent park commissions were consolidated into the Chicago Park District, and the new agency soon secured federal funds through the Works Progress Administration. WPA improvements at Portage Park included additional plantings, whimsical stonework fountains and gateways, and a comfort station. WPA workers also removed the original swimming lagoon and constructed a kidney-shaped concrete pool. In 1959, the park district replaced the concrete pool with an Olympic-sized pool in preparation for hosting the Pan American Games. In 1972, Portage Park hosted the U.S. Olympic swimming trials, where Gold Medalist Mark Spitz set new world's records. In 1998, the swimming pools and plaza area were rehabilitated and an interactive water play area was created for children. The 1922 fieldhouse is now being used as a cultural center, offering art crafts, drama, music, and senior citizens programs. "

In 1931, the park district purchased property for two additional parks, Chippewa and Pottawattomie. Pottawattomie Park was the idea of the Birchwood Improvement Association, which lobbied for the establishment of a community center east of Ridge Avenue and north of Rogers Avenue. The park's name honors the Pottawattomie (Potawatomi) Indians, one of nine tribal groups living around the Great Lakes after 1600. The Pottawattomies lived on the eastern edge of Lake Michigan until about 1760, when they moved westward into the Chicago region. Although many Pottawattomies intermarried with French, British, and American traders, the tribe was nevertheless forced from the area after the Blackhawk War of 1832. A large Works Progress Administration painting in the park fieldhouse depicts a meeting between Native Americans and whites. "

  "history": "Located just north of the Harold Washington Library, Pritzker Park is located on the former site of the Rialto, the last single-room occupancy hotel downtown which was demolished in 1990. At the time, the Harold Washington Library was under construction, and the City developed the park as an outdoor enhancement to the new library. The city\u2019s Department of Planning and the non-profit group Sculpture Chicago commissioned New York artist Ronald Jones to design the space. Jones created an installation inspired by Rene Magritte\u2019s famous surrealist painting entitled \u201cThe Banquet,\u201d as well as the circular benches, known as council rings, by landscape architect Jens Jensen who began his career in Chicago\u2019s parks. When Pritzker Park opened in 1991 with the Ronald Jones-designed improvements, it was unclear as to whether the park would remain as open space or eventually be developed. Two years later, Chicago\u2019s Department of Planning and Development created design guidelines as part of a State Street plan recommending that the park should remain as a permanent green space. That year, 100 boulders were installed throughout the Loop to commemorate the achievements of 100 important Chicago women, including several in and near the park. The boulder installation was especially appropriate because the park is named for an extremely significant Chicago woman, Cindy Pritzker. A member of the Library Board of Directors from 1984 - 1998, and its president from 1989 \u2013 1998, Cindy Pritzker was a tireless leader of the Chicago Public Libraries, spearheading the construction over thirty new branch libraries and the Harold Washington Library Center. She was the founder and chair of the Chicago Public Library Foundation, serving in that position until June of 2004. During her tenure, the Foundation saw the creation and growth of an endowment in excess of $20 million to support book collections, technology and programming. Cindy Pritzker also serves on the University of Chicago Women\u2019s Board, and is a co-founder of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. In addition to the park, the Harold Washington Library Auditorium has been named in Cindy Pritzker\u2019s honor. After the Chicago Park District assumed ownership of Prizker Park in 2008, the agency commissioned Hoerr Schaudt landscape architects to redesign the space. Their improvements included new plantings, a long angular knee-wall inscribed with quotations from famous authors, concession stands and seating and a plaza. The plaza was designed to allow for temporary art installations. The most recent was Tony Tasset\u2019s sculpture \u2018EYE\u2019, a 30-foot tall plexiglass eyeball. "

  "history": "In the mid-1890s, Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham began sketching a magnificent park and boulevard that would link Jackson Park with downtown. As Chief of Construction for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, Burnham (1846- 1912) had transformed sandy, wind-swept, Jackson Park into the glistening White City. After the fair, Burnham began imagining a more beautiful, orderly, and functional Chicago. Burnham's vision, including a south lakefront park with a series of man made islands, linear boating harbor, beaches, meadows, and play fields, was published in his seminal 1909 Plan of Chicago. The South Park Commission wanted to create the park, however development was delayed by disputes with the Illinois Central Railroad over riparian rights. Property rights and government approvals were finally secured in 1920, and voters approved a $20 million bond issue to create the park. By the time the site was named Burnham Park in 1927, only the northern part of the site had been filled. In 1933 and 1934, the Century of Progress, Chicago's second World's Fair took place in Burnham Park. In the mid-1930s, the newly created Chicago Park District used federal funds from the Works Progress Administration to complete landfill operations and improve Burnham Park, including the naturalistic Promontory Point landscape by renowned designer Alfred Caldwell. In 1935, Mayor Edward J. Kelly began pursuing the idea of a permanent fair in Burnham Park. To facilitate this, the state passed a bill creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority. The legislation allowed the construction of Merrill C. Meigs Airport in 1946 and the McCormick Place convention hall in 1960. The original McCormick Place burned down in 1967, and despite opposition, a new facility opened in Burnham Park in 1971. In recent years, Mayor Richard M. Daley's vision for a greener, more beautiful Burnham Park has begun taking shape. Sixty acres of asphalt were transformed into a landscaped Museum Campus. And the former Meigs Field has been transformed into a 91-acre natural area park, known as Northerly Island where park patrons can enjoy a paved all-purpose trail. Birders catch glimpses of migrating birds in the fall and spring seasons, while anglers can find the perfect fishing spot. "

  "history": "In 1872, when developers were platting the early suburb of Morgan Park, they set aside nearly three acres of property on Prospect Avenue as parkland. In 1905, the Village of Morgan Park transferred the property to the Calumet Park District, one of 19 neighborhood park boards created after 1895 to supplement the original three park districts, the South, the West, and the Lincoln Park Commissions. In 1906, the Calumet Park District officially designated the park, originally known as Prospect Park, Prospect Gardens. At the same time, the District adopted a park plan designed by noted landscape architect Jens Jensen, who was then General Superintendent of the West Park Commission and also ran a thriving private practice. Among Jensen's creations was a lily pond begun in 1909. The following year, the park district expanded the park by purchasing a small triangular tract adjoining Prospect Gardens. The Chicago Park District took control of Prospect Gardens in 1934, when the 22 park boards were consolidated into a unified district. "

",
  "history": "The West Park Commissioners created Pulaski Park in 1912, as part of an effort to expand neighborhood parks throughout the congested west side. Several years earlier, Dvorak, Eckhart and Stanford Parks opened, providing tenement districts with breathing spaces and social services including public bathing, branch libraries, children's playgrounds, athletics and inexpensive hot meals. Sites were soon identified for new parks, including a 3.8-acre parcel in West Town\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a crowded, predominantly Polish neighborhood of factories and workers' housing. To make way for the park, the West Park Commission had to displace 1,200 people, demolishing some buildings, and moving others to nearby locations in the neighborhood. After filling the low site, the contractors began improvements following the plans of renowned landscape designer Jens Jensen. A large field house and outdoor swimming facility were constructed in 1914. Incorporating elements such as tile roofs, half-timbering, a tower, dormers and verandahs, architect William Carbys Zimmerman designed the three-story brick field house to emulate Eastern European architecture familiar to the immigrant community. In 1919, Jensen met with officials at the Art Institute of Chicago to discuss the idea of a competition for art students to paint a mural on the semi-circular proscenium above the stage in the Pulaski Park field house. The park commissioners provided the prizes of $100, $50 and $25, and instructors at the School of the Art Institute selected the winners. The first prize went to James G. Gilbert, who received $200 for materials as well as the $100 prize. In 1920, Gilbert painted his mural composed of a dramatic series of allegorical figures. A second mural, hidden in the upper tower room, portrays Polish themes. A Chicago Park District arts and crafts class created this painting in the late 1930s. The park pays tribute to Casimir Pulaski (c. 1748-1779) a Polish war hero who fought for the American cause in the Revolutionary War. After distinguishing himself in the Battle of Brandywine, Pulaski was appointed by Congress as Brigadier-General. Pulaski died in action at the Battle of Savannah. "

George Pullman vastly improved the comfort of long distance rail travel when he introduced the sleeping car that bears his name. In 1877, Pullman began to buy up 3,500 acres of land on the western shore of Lake Calumet on which to build his new factory. Plant construction began in 1880. To lure well-qualified workers, Pullman also built worker housing, stores, churches, and public buildings - an enormous company town. Pullman hired architect Solon S. Beman to design the town's buildings and Nathan F. Barrett to plan the landscape. By 1884, Pullman had around 8,000 residents.

  "history": "Named for the U.S. Army's 42nd Rainbow Division that fought gallantly in World War I, Rainbow Beach & Park began as two separate municipal beaches. The first was established in 1908 by the Special Parks Commission, a city agency that studied open space needs and created parks, playgrounds, and beaches in densely- populated areas of Chicago. This small site at 79th Street and Lake Michigan was known as Rocky Ledge Beach. The name referred to the area's rocky terrain, and to the manmade limestone ledge that served as a shore promenade and provided protection from shoreline erosion. By 1912, the heavily-used beach had bathrooms and changing rooms. Illuminated by electric lights, the beach remained open until 9:30 p.m. for the benefit of working men and women. In 1914, the city began efforts to expand the beach, and soon acquired land between 75th Street and Rocky Ledge Beach. The City Council officially named the new site Rainbow Beach in 1918. The smaller, adjacent Rocky Ledge Beach continued operating as a children's beach. The two beaches were consolidated in 1959, when the Chicago Park District began leasing the site from the city. For many years the park lacked sufficient indoor recreational facilities, so in 1999 a large fieldhouse was constructed. Designed by David Woodhouse Architects, the fieldhouse takes full advantage of Rainbow Beach & Park's breathtaking views of the lakefront and skyline. "

  "history": "The establishment of Ashburn Flying Field, a World War I pilot training facility and Chicago's first airport, spurred development in Chicago's Ashburn community. By the late 1920s, area residents needed a park to serve their fledgling community. On October 19, 1929, the South Park Commission agreed to purchase a substantial property in Ashburn. Unfortunately, the stock market crashed just a ten days later, and the resulting financial hardships prevented the South Park Commission from improving the site. In 1934, the city's 22 independent park boards were consolidated into the Chicago Park District, and the newly-formed agency took control of the Ashburn property. Park district designers soon developed a preliminary plan for the site, already called Rainey Park for Edward J. Rainey (1905-1911), an influential South Park Commissioner who advocated neighborhood park creation. Though the initial Rainey Park plans were not executed, the property did serve as a temporary nursery. In 1942, when the U.S. Defense Department condemned the northern half of the park for a Chrysler Corporation airplane factory, the park district purchased property to the south. In late 1945, the Chicago Housing Authority leased Rainey Park to provide temporary housing for returning World War II veterans. The lease ended in December, 1956, at which time the park district sold a portion of its land to the Chicago Board of Education for the new Hancock Elementary School. Improvements finally began at Rainey Park in 1959. Park facilities soon included a baseball diamond, tennis and horseshoe courts, and playground equipment. From the beginning, the park and the adjacent school have been jointly operated by the park district and the Board of Education. Though Hancock School closed for several years in the 1980s, the park district continued to use the building for programs, and the school has since reopened. The school gymnasium doubles as a fieldhouse for Rainey Park. "

  "history": "In 1913, New York real estate speculator William Harmon began developing the lovely Ravenswood Manor and Ravenswood Gardens neighborhoods. Residents soon voted to form their own park district, electing Mrs. Helen Meder the first president of its board. Although these were comfortable, middle-class neighborhoods, the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Park District had limited resources because its tax-base included only a 1/4-mile area. As a result, it created very small parks which emphasized landscape improvements, rather than recreational facilities. In 1915, the district acquired land for Ravenswood Manor Park, which was named for the surrounding community. The triangular site, originally bisected by Eastwood Avenue, soon included trees, shrubs, benches, a trellis-like pergola, and a small stucco office building. The park district held its meetings in the building, and made it available for many other community purposes. Among the groups who met there was the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Community Club, which apparently encouraged attendance by passing out cigars at meetings. Boys' and girls' clubs, Red Cross volunteer groups, and other civic organizations also used the building. In 1934, Ravenswood Manor Park became part of the newly-formed Chicago Park District. Using federal relief funds, the park district rehabilitated the park's landscape, planting hundreds of shrubs and an impressive perennial garden. The park office building was razed in 1956. Fifteen years later, playground equipment was installed in the park. In 1990, the city closed the bisecting stretch of Eastwood Avenue and the park district sodded-over the street. Since that time, Ravenswood Manor Park has received numerous improvements including a major replanting, a soft surface playground, and a new pergola. "

  "history": "Revere Park lies just east of the Chicago River's North Branch, in the North Center neighborhood, once home to a nationally important brick making industry. In 1898, Wolfram Blaul built a brick factory on the 9-acre property that would later become Revere Park. In little more than a decade, however, the site's clay pits were being used as a city dump. By 1917, River Park District Commissioner John J. O'Shea had tired of this eyesore, and began to push for a park on the site. O'Shea quickly won over the park board, which acquired the property in 1921. Improvements began the following year. Blaul's original cottage was remodeled as a fieldhouse, and some planting began. In 1926, another River Park District board member, Albert F. Otte, suggested that the new park, then known as O'Shea Park, be dedicated to the honor of patriot Paul Revere (1735-1818). Revere, a silversmith, made a famous midnight ride through the Massachusetts countryside to warn of the British approach during the early days of the American Revolution. By 1928, Jacob L. Crane, Jr., a landscape architect and an early River Park board member, had prepared detailed plans for Revere Park. The Chicago Landscape Company executed a modified version of Crane's plans that included an athletic fields and tennis courts set in a green landscape of trees and curving paths. Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld designed a slate-roofed, brick fieldhouse, dedicated in 1931. Blaul's old cottage was remodeled yet again, this time for use as a community house. In 1934, the River Park District and 21 other independent park commissions consolidated into the unified Chicago Park District. The Chicago Park District installed a wading pool with sand courts and a shelter house in 1948. Around 1960, the park district demolished the original cottage, replacing it with a new boys' club building. The park received a new soft surface playground in 1989. "

In 2004, the Board of Commissioners renamed the park in honor of Guadalupe Reyes as part of an initiative to recognize the contributions of Chicago women. Guadalupe Reyes (1918- 2000) was an activist and community leader devoted to improving the lives of Chicago\u2019s Hispanic residents. One of eight children born to a family of Mexican immigrants, Guadalupe Reyes had little formal education. Despite this, she devoted her life to improving the plight of children, seniors, and the disabled. After one of her eleven children suffered severe disabilities caused by spinal meningitis in the 1950s, she began a 50-year campaign addressing the needs of people with disabilities. In 1969, Reyes established a school for children with developmental disabilities called Esperanza, which means hope in Spanish. In 1973, she founded El Valor, which means courage. This organization, still active today, provides many services to children, families, seniors, and people with disabilities.\u00a0Reyes was also a leading force in the struggle to create Benito Juarez High School. She was active in the Pilsen Neighbor Community Council, and helped establish the Proyecto Maravialla, a Pilsen senior citizens\u2019 center. Reyes played a pivotal role in creating the Fiesta del Sol, an annual neighborhood festival in Pilsen. Over her lifetime, she received many honors and awards including a 1988 article about her achievements published in Reader\u2019s Digest. Kraft Foods named a scholarship for her, and El Valor has a Children and Family Center named for her. It is appropriate to rename Rose Park in her honor as it lies in the heart of Pilsen. "

  "history": "Ridge Park was the first of five Beverly neighborhood parks created by the Ridge Park District, one of 22 independent park boards consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Soon after its 1908 establishment, the Ridge Park District began a search for park property. Enthusiastic residents advocated the purchase of property along Longwood Drive, already the site of \"fine homes set in spacious grounds.\" The park district's board of commissioners agreed, and in 1911 and 1912 purchased 9.32 acres of property, including a small, city-owned park. The new park was named Ridge Park for the tree-studded ridge that runs along the park's western boundary, the one-time shore line of glacial Lake Chicago. John Todd Hetherington (1858 - 1936) was a Canadian-born architect who lived in the Beverly neighborhood served as a member of the Ridge Park Board of Commissioners from 1911 to 1913. Hetherington had originally recommended another local architect, Arthur Foster, to design the park. In 1912, however, the other board members asked Hetherington to take on the project. Hetherington created an original plan including a small field house, outdoor swimming pool, wading pool, and a running track. Constructed in 1913, the building and athletic facilities were all surrounded by a restful landscape of trees, shrubbery, flowers, lawns, and walks. The fashionable Beverly district grew dramatically during the 1920s, and by late in that decade, Ridge Park was in need of a much larger field house. By this time, John T. Hetherington had formed a partnership with his son Murray D. Hetherington (1891 - 1972). The Ridge Park District commissioned Hetherington architects to design a much larger brick fieldhouse for the park. They retained a part of the old field house as the auditorium, incorporating some of the room's original features such as its trusses. They also built the addition around the outdoor swimming pool, which then became an indoor aquatic facility. In addition to the indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, auditorium and club rooms, the building also provided a home for the John H. Vanderpoel Memorial Art Gallery, a collection of some 500 works by American painters and sculptors. The Vanderpoel collection was assembled to honor the contributions of Beverly resident John H. Vanderpoel (1857-1911), who taught painting at the Art Institute for more than 30 years and who, with his mentor, Art Institute Director, W.M.R. French, helped to make Beverly a culturally-rich community. Most of the works displayed were donated by the artists themselves out of respect for Vanderpoel's genius. Ridge Park includes a number of monuments to veterans of various wars. In the early 1990s, the park district grouped these together in a single memorial area when the community sought to recognize Beverly resident and U.S. Marine Corps Captain William J. Hurley (1963-1991), who died while on a training mission during the Desert Storm conflict. "

  "history": "Teddy Roosevelt once said that Jacob A. Riis came nearer than anyone to being \"the ideal American.\" Riis (1849-1914), a photojournalist and reformer, drew national attention to the plight of the inner-city poor through his expose, How the Other Half Lives. Riis advocated the creation of small playgrounds to provide \"breathing spaces\" for densely-populated urban neighborhoods. His 1898 speech at Chicago's Hull House inspired local reformers to petition for city playgrounds. By the time the Northwest Park District created Riis Park in 1916, the playground movement Riis had helped to inspire had in turn fueled park-building across the nation. The park district designed Riis Park to provide a broad range of recreational amenities for its developing middle class neighborhood. The park remained essentially undeveloped until 1928, however, when the park district installed a ski jump and golf course, and commissioned locally-prominent architect Walter W. Alschlager to design a fieldhouse. In 1934, Riis Park came under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Park District, which used Works Progress Administration funding for further improvements. Riis Park developed in two distinct halves separated by a steep glacial ridge, a remnant of the shoreline of Lake Chicago. To the east stood the Georgian-revival fieldhouse, surrounded by various other athletic facilities. Respected landscape architect Alfred Caldwell designed the western portion of the park. Caldwell's plan, fully implemented by 1940, incorporated naturalistic plantings; a stone-edged lagoon; shady, enclosed areas; and a broad, sunny meadow. "

  "history": "At 30 acres, River Park is the largest of the six parks established by the River Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Northwest side residents created the River Park District in 1917 to provide recreational opportunities and increase property values in the territory along the Chicago River's North Branch and the North Shore Channel. Almost immediately after its creation, the River Park District began to purchase land north of Argyle Avenue, where the river and the channel separate. Although land acquisition was not completed until 1922, the site opened to the public on July 4, 1920, when the park district dedicated a new flag pole there to neighborhood children. Formal improvements began two years later, with the remodeling of an existing building for fieldhouse use. In 1926, landscape architect and River Park District board member Jacob L. Crane, Jr. developed a plan for River Park. Crane's plan covered nearly 40 acres of land, including approximately ten acres northwest of the fork. (This ten-acre plot was never actually developed as parkland, and now belongs to North Park College.) In 1927, the Chicago Landscape Company implemented a modified version of Crane's plan that included beautiful greenspaces, a foot bridge over the North Branch dam and waterfall, children's playgrounds, athletic fields, and pathways for walking, bicycling, and horseback riding. Chicago architect Clarence Hatzfeld designed an impressive brick fieldhouse with a three-story central section and a long wing on either end. Constructed in 1929 to replace the original structure, the fieldhouse included a 300-seat assembly hall and a fully-equipped kitchen. The Chicago Park District installed a new swimming pool in 1948, and a new bath house in 1970. During the fall of 1999, the City of Chicago began constructing a boat launch and river walk along the south side of the North Branch, which the park district will operate once completed. "

  "history": "In the years following World War II, the Chicago Park District began a major effort to create new parks in rapidly-growing neighborhoods. As part of this initiative, a committee formed in 1946 with representatives of the Chicago Park District and Board of Education to determine how facilities could jointly serve as schools and parks. At that time, the Chicago Park District had identified dozens of sites for park expansion and 16 of them were adjacent to existing schools. The Joint Committee on School-Parks studied the 16 locations and made specific recommendations for additions to the school buildings, and improvements to the surrounding grounds including playgrounds, athletic fields, and passive landscape areas. The proposed improvements included club rooms and gymnasiums for use during afterschool hours and weekends. Mount Vernon Elementary School in Chicago\u2019s Washington Heights neighborhood was one of the initial 16 schools identified for the program. The park district began purchasing land adjacent to Mount Vernon School in 1946, and plans for the new School-Park were published in the Chicago Tribune in 1955. Two years later, the Chicago Park District and Board of Education completed the project. Both the park and the adjacent school were originally named Mount Vernon, for George Washington's Virginia home. In 1999, the Chicago Park District formally renamed the park in response to the Mount Vernon Park Advisory Council\u2019s suggestion that it should honor baseball great Jackie Robinson (1919-1972). When he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, Robinson became the first African-American to play major league baseball.

  "history": "Rogers Beach Park is one of 18 street-end beaches acquired by the Chicago Park District from the City of Chicago in 1959. By that time, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had been operating such small municipal beaches since at least 1921. Many of these beaches were located in the Rogers Park neighborhood, where a growing population of apartment dwellers lacked easy access to recreational opportunities. In contrast to the city's larger municipal beaches, the street-end beaches, though manned by lifeguards, had no changing rooms or other facilities. Rogers Avenue and the adjacent beach take their names from Phillip Rogers (1812-1856), the first white settler in the area. Rogers, an Irish immigrant, arrived from New York in 1836 and soon became a successful truck farmer, amassing over 1,600 acres of land before he died. His son-in-law, Patrick L. Touhy (1839-1911), later subdivided some of Rogers' land and named the town Rogers Park in his honor. "

  "history": "In 1929, the City of Chicago built a new pumping station east of the channelized North Branch of the Chicago River to meet the increasing need for water in the neighboring Lincoln Square and Albany Park communities. Just over thirty years later, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and the Chicago Park District began working together to create recreational space adjoining the pumping station. The park district soon signed a lease for 7.5 acres of water district land, and by the mid-1960s, playgrounds and greenspaces lined both sides of the North Shore Channel. In the 1990s, the park district began leasing additional water district land, bringing the park's total acreage to nearly 13 acres. The entire park was rehabilitated, and a bike path added as part of a larger plan to create a recreational corridor along the river. Ronan Park honors Ensign George Ronan, who died in the Fort Dearborn Massacre on August 15, 1812, when Potowatomi warriors routed the Federal forces at Chicago.

Both the park and adjacent Roosevelt Road take their names from Theodore Roosevelt (1856-1919), 26th President of the United States. Roosevelt was a New York Republican who was elected Vice President in 1896. He rose to the nation's highest office in 1901, after an assassin killed President William McKinley. A lover of America's wilderness, Roosevelt is sometimes called the \"Conservation President\" because it was under his administration that the federal government first took a serious interest in protecting natural lands and established the U.S. Forest Service. Roosevelt was also an advocate of city park creation, and in 1907 pronounced Chicago's revolutionary system of south side neighborhood parks \"one of the most notable civic achievements of any American city.\" "

The following year, the park came under the control of the Chicago Park District when the Jefferson Park District and 21 other park commissions merged to form the new consolidated district. Rosedale Park takes its name from the avenue that runs along its southern border. The street was in turn named for Rosedale, Pennsylvania, the hometown of John Lewis Cochran (1857-1923), the developer of the Edgewater community along Chicago's lakeshore. "

  "history": "Rosenblum Park was one of many parks created as part of a ten-year plan to provide additional recreational space for post-World War II Chicago. For the well-established South Shore neighborhood, the park district chose a three-block site bisected by a railroad right-of-way and occupied by a coal company, a gas station, a ball field, and a number of homes. The process of land acquisition began in 1946, but obtaining the property proved somewhat difficult, and the process was not complete until 1953. Demolition began the same year. Though the rail line still divided the property in two, the city agreed to vacate South Bennett and South Euclid Streets, which had further carved up the parkland. The park district soon added a small recreational building and tennis and shuffleboard courts to supplement the existing softball field, and planted numerous red oaks and other new trees. For several decades, the park district and the Chicago Board of Education jointly operated the 9-acre park along with adjacent board-owned property. In 1965, the park district sold a small portion of its land to the Board of Education for an addition to South Shore High School. The two agencies terminated their cooperative agreement in 1980. Three years later, the park district expanded the park by acquiring the railroad right-of-way that still cut through the park. During its early years, the park was known as South Shore Park for the surrounding community. In 1965, however, the park district renamed the site Rosenblum Park in honor of J. Leslie Rosenblum , a long-time South Shore resident. Rosenblum, a local pharmacist, was an active participant in the South Shore Chamber of Commerce and the area Lions Club. A strong supporter of the Neighborhood Boys' Club, he left his estate to the organization upon his death. "

  "history": "In 1958, the City of Chicago purchased a quarter-acre property in the growing southwest side Archer Heights community from the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Although the city transferred the site to the Chicago Park District the following year, it remained undeveloped until around 1970, when the park district improved it with playground equipment, a basketball court, a curved walkway, and a short stone wall for seating. In January, 2000, the park was nearly doubled in size when the park district acquired the right-of-way of adjacent West 45th Street and South Hamlin Avenue. Officially designated Walnut Park in 1973, the park was one of many properties named for trees and plants at the time. The term \"walnut\" encompasses a genus of nut-bearing hardwood trees that include the European walnut, the butternut or white walnut, and the black or American walnut. The black walnut is one of the country's most valuable and sought-after timber trees. Its fine-grained, dark-toned wood has been used for high-quality American furniture and cabinetry since colonial times. When white settlers arrived in Illinois in the late 18th- and early 19th-centuries, the black walnut was common to the region's woodlands and along its river banks. Unfortunately, due to its usefulness, the tree became scarce within a few short decades. "

  "history": "The visionary South Park Commission superintendent J. Frank Foster conceived Russell Square along with nine other revolutionary parks that opened to the public in 1905. These innovative parks provided social services as well as breathing spaces to overcrowded tenement neighborhoods on Chicago's south side. In addition to year-round recreational facilities and social activities, the new parks offered English lessons and other educational programs, the earliest branches of the Chicago Public Library, inexpensive hot meals, free public bathing facilities, and other health services. The ten parks, which quickly proved to be nationally influential, included Russell, Mark White, Davis, Armour, and Cornell Squares, and Bessemer, Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, and Hamilton Parks. Although the entire system was originally designed by the Olmsted Brothers landscape architects and Daniel H. Burnham & Co. architects, Russell Square has undergone many changes. The fieldhouse designed by Chicago Park District architects replaced the original building in 1967. The park pays tribute to Martin J. Russell (1845-1900), an accomplished native Chicagoan. After serving as Lieutenant in the Union Army during the Civil War, Russell began a career in journalism. In 1874, he began serving on the Board of Education, and two years later, he was elected Town Clerk. In 1880, he was appointed to the Board of the South Park Commission. He continued serving on the board until 1894, when President Cleveland appointed him Collector of Customs for the port of Chicago. Russell resigned from the collectorship in 1897 and continued in his journalistic career. "

  "history": "In mid-1999, the Chicago Park District combined three of its parks (Rutherford, Sayre, and Rutherford Sayre) to form Rutherford Sayre Park. The three separate parks, lying adjacent to the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad tracks on the city's northwest side, had long been treated as one by area residents. All three were set aside as parkland just before World War I and came under the control of the Chicago Park District in 1959. The park properties were donated by two local families, the Sayres and Rutherfords, who had farmed and later subdivided the surrounding area. The western portions of the parkland had been part of the Sayre homestead, purchased by William E. Sayre in the early 1830s. Thomas A. Rutherford, the area's first postmaster, donated the eastern section, at the southwest corner of Belden and Oak Park Avenues. In 1916, the Northwest Park District began to improve the area north of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul tracks, erecting a fieldhouse with an assembly hall and a gymnasium. Per a stipulation in the Rutherford deed, the fieldhouse originally included a bowling alley as well, an unusual feature for a Chicago park fieldhouse. In the 1920s, the Chicago Landscape Company designed a spray pool for the park. "

  "history": "Sauganash Park and its surrounding neighborhood bear the name of Potawatomi chief and early Chicagoan Sauganash (1780-1841), also known as Billy Caldwell. Born in Canada of a Wyandot Indian mother and an Irish father, Sauganash (\"The Englishman\"), was educated by Jesuit priests at the French settlement of Detroit. Sauganash became a Chicago resident in 1820, and was elected a justice of the peace six years later. In 1830, the federal government granted him a 1,200-acre reservation along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Sauganash sold most of his land six years later, moving to Council Bluffs, Iowa, to join the Potowatomis. For nearly a century, farmers held much of the reservation land. In the mid-1920s, however, Henry G. Zander, Sr. and George F. Koester began to subdivide the area for homes. In 1926, residents of northwest Chicago's prestigious new Sauganash development petitioned for a park board to create recreational facilities in their growing community. The newly-formed Sauganash Park District acquired nearly four acres of property from developer Koester in late 1928. In August 1930, the district approved park plans and began improvements including walks, tennis and horse shoe courts, and a wading pool. Work was completed by Christmas Eve, and the district illuminated the park lights in celebration. Construction of a single-story, English-style fieldhouse with a 300-seat auditorium began in March of 1934. The Chicago Park District assumed ownership of Sauganash Park only two months later. The consolidated park district added ball fields and playground equipment and made other improvements over time. In the mid-1970s, the park district acquired another acre-and-a-half of adjacent property and built a large gymnasium addition to the fieldhouse "

  "history": "In 1908, the City of Chicago opened a public bath in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, one of 14 such facilities operated by the Chicago Department of Health at the time. The first of these baths had opened in 1894 at the urging of social reformers, who sought to provide health and hygiene services for overcrowded inner-city neighborhoods where few residences had running water. The city named the Lincoln Park bath for leading Chicago physician Fernand Henrotin (1847-1906), who served as surgeon to both the Fire and Police Departments for many years. The Bureau of Parks and Recreation began operating the public baths on behalf of the city around 1930. By this time, living conditions were improving, and bath attendance had long since begun to decline. Still, as late as 1945, Henrotin Bath drew 24,000 patrons, more thantwo-thirds paid no admission. In the mid-1950s, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation developed plans for a small playground on property adjacent to the bath house. Shortly thereafter, the new playground was designated Schaefer Park, in honor of local civic leader and Republican precinct captain Edward J. Schaefer (1895-1955). Schaefer, an aid to 44th Ward Alderman John Burmeister, suffered a fatal heart attack while listening to election returns at the alderman's campaign headquarters. The city transferred Schaefer Park and the adjacent Henrotin Bath to the Chicago Park District in 1959. In 1971, the park district demolished the aging bath house, expanding the playground unto the now empty site. In 1992, a new soft surface playground was installed. "

The Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners officially named the new park in honor of Clara D. Schafer in 2014. \u00a0Clara Dorothy Schafer (c. 1898 \u2013 1972) was a nurse and hospital administrator who saved South Chicago Hospital (now Advocate Trinity Hospital) from extinction. \u00a0Born and raised in Chicago, Schafer had considered pursuing a career in the opera or theater, but decided to devote her life to helping others. \u00a0She graduated from Chicago\u2019s Burnside Hospital School of Nursing in 1917, and began working as an assistant superintendent in the hospital. Three years later, she became superintendent and administrator of South Chicago Hospital.

  "history": "As late as 1870, there were fewer than ten families living west of Ridge Avenue in what is now the southwestern portion of Rogers Park. Among these were the Schreibers. Nicholas and Katherine Schreiber had arrived from Mainz, Germany in 1848, purchasing 40 acres of land near Devon Avenue and Green Bay Road (now Clark Street). Nicholas died suddenly just a few months before the birth of his twin sons, Dominick and Michael. Raised by their mother and an older brother, the twins eventually took control of the family farm. They expanded their holdings to 160 acres, and engaged in truck farming. Dominick built greenhouses on the land, and found success in the floral business. In 1877, he built a two-story frame house on Ridge Avenue, near his boyhood home. Twenty years later, the brothers subdivided their land; Schreiber Avenue runs through their former farmstead. Schreiber Park is among numerous playgrounds established by the City of Chicago in the years following World War II. Land acquisition began in 1948. By the time of the park's October, 1950 dedication, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation had improved the site with a shelter house, a sand box, and a playing field that was flooded for ice skating in winter. The city transferred Schreiber Park to the Chicago Park District in 1959. In 1997, the park district expanded the site through an Illinois Department of Natural Resources development grant, bringing the park's size to just over an acre. "

  "history": "During World War I, Ashburn Flying Field, a pilot training facility and Chicago's first airport, was established in the sparsely-settled Ashburn community. By the late 1940s, the area's population was beginning to surge, but residents had few recreational opportunities. In 1952, builder/developer Raymond Lutgert subdivided the old air field, creating the new community of Scottsdale, named for Lutgert's son, Scott. Among the significant institutions in the quickly-growing subdivision was St. Bede the Venerable Catholic Parish, which built a temporary church at West 83rd Street and South Scottsdale Avenue before the end of 1953. Only a year-and-a-half later, St. Bede Parish had outgrown its first home, and the Bishop of Chicago sold the church property to the Chicago Park District for park development. The park district soon remodelled the temporary church for use as a recreation building, and improved the site with playground equipment, a softball diamond, and a basketball and volleyball court. In 1979, the park district demolished the original church structure to make way for a new fieldhouse, dedicated in September, 1981. More recently, the park district added a combination football/soccer field and a new soft surface playground. "

  "history": "Located just east of Chicago's historic Water Tower Pumping Station, tiny Seneca Park provides a quiet oasis from bustling Michigan Avenue. The Chicago Park District leases the park property from the City of Chicago Water Fund. As early as 1907, the eastern portion of this park was considered part of nearby Lake Shore Playground, and developed as such by the Lincoln Park Commission. In 1915, the State of Illinois built an armory on Chicago Avenue, between Seneca and Lake Shore Parks, permanently separating the two park spaces. By 1950, the Department of Public Works was managing this property as Seneca Park. The Chicago Park District began to lease the parkland from the city in 1959. Seneca Park features both a lawn with shaded walkways and a playlot. Ben, a horse sculpture by Debra Butterfield \u00a0was installed in the park in 1990. Although the sculpture looks as though it is made of many pieces of wood, it is actually composed of bronze. The Eli Schulman Playground Committee donated the artwork as part of a major playground renovation effort. The playground is named for Eli M. Schulman (1910-1988), a well-known restaurateur who was active in promoting recreational activities for children. During his varied career, Schulman served as Deputy Coroner and on the board of McCormick Place, and participated in many charitable works. The park itself takes its name from adjacent Seneca Street, named for the Iroquois tribe of upstate New York. "

When in 1990 the railroad announced plans to terminate the lease and sell the parkland for development, the community protested. Fortunately, the park district, with the help of the Trust for Public Land, successfully negotiated the purchase of the leased property, together with adjoining land, and tripled the park's size. The park district, the board of education, and the city have since pooled their resources to develop state-of-the-art recreational facilities at the site. "

  "history": "Completed in 1908, Seward Park was one of the Lincoln Park Commission's first three neighborhood parks. Although the park commission was established in 1869 to manage Lincoln Park and its connecting boulevards, by the turn of the century administrators were concerned about the living conditions in densely-populated neighborhoods within their jurisdiction. Approval of a 1907 bond issue allowed the acquisition of land for Seward and Stanton Parks, along with improvements to Lake Shore Playground, which was already part of the Lincoln Park System. Prairie School architect Dwight H. Perkins designed the Seward Park fieldhouse. An advocate for playgrounds in congested districts and a leader in saving the forest preserves, Perkins served as architect to the Chicago Board of Education during the period in which he also worked for the Lincoln Park Commission. Perkins' fieldhouse included gymnasiums, shower baths, a reading room, club rooms, and an assembly hall equipped with a movable stage and an electric lantern with an attachment for educational moving pictures. The Lincoln Park Commissioners decided to name new parks after President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet members. William H. Seward (1801-1872) was the Secretary of State during Lincoln's administration. "

  "history": "Shabbona Park is among the four parks established by the Old Portage Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Created in 1912, the Old Portage Park District aimed to improve property values and provide substantial recreational facilities for the middle class Portage Park community. Nearby Portage Park, begun in 1913, met with such success, that residents of the adjacent Dunning neighborhood sought to expand the district's borders into their community. This annexation was completed in 1925 and, early the following year, the Old Portage Park District began acquiring an 18.7-acre property identified by the Dunning Park Improvement Association. Before long, the new park had winding walkways, spacious lawns, flower beds, and a sunken garden, as well as baseball and football fields and a large playground. In 1928, the park district built a Georgian-style brick fieldhouse with a 300-seat assembly hall, a kitchen, and various club, game, and shower rooms. The structure is identical to the Chopin and Wilson Park fieldhouses. After Shabbona Park's 1934 transfer to the Chicago Park District, the unified agency installed softball fields and a new baseball diamond. By 1946, the park district had developed plans for gymnasium and swimming pool additions to the heavily-used fieldhouse. However, the gymnasium was not constructed until 1959, and a natatorium came slightly more than a decade after that. During the 1990s, the park district rehabilitated many of Shabbona Park's major features. Shabbona Park takes its name from the Potawatomi chief Shabbona (ca. 1775-1859). Shabbona and his people continued to live in northeastern Illinois well after the establishment of Chicago's Fort Dearborn in 1803. In the early 1830s, Shabbona warned white settlers of the Sac chief Black Hawk's intentions to take back his ancestral lands in western Illinois. Though Shabbona's warnings saved many lives, his people were nevertheless removed to a reservation west of the Mississippi in 1837. The people of Ottawa, Illinois warmly welcomed Shabbona when he returned in 1854. Shabbona died there five years later. "

  "history": "Born on a farm in New Hampshire, John Graves Shedd (1850-1926) began working as a store clerk at the age of 17. He decided to go west and arrived in Chicago in 1872. Striving to work at the \"biggest store in town,\" Shedd took a $10-a-week job as stockboy in the Field, Leiter and Company Store. He quickly rose to higher positions. Promoted to partner in what was then Marshall Field and Company in 1893, Shedd became vice-president in 1901 and then president of the store after Marshall Field died in 1906. Among his numerous charitable efforts and contributions, Shedd donated $3 million to the South Park Commissioners to build the Shedd Aquarium in Grant Park. In 1885, Shedd began developing part of South Lawndale's Millard and Decker subdivision. To enhance the area and its property values, he reserved 1.13 acres for what was initially called Shedd's Park. Although Shedd intended to improve the private park through a local assessment, his neighbors did not want to be taxed, and they suggested that it should be made a public park. In 1888, he sold the site to the city, reserving a small lot on the park's north side for the construction of a Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad station. Ten years later, the city transferred the unimproved park to the West Park Commission. Shortly thereafter, the railroad delivered, free of charge, 196 carloads of soil for planted slopes to screen the train tracks. Shedd helped the commissioners gain title to the train station lot in 1914, and the building was demolished. Two years later, probably based on the recommendation of landscape architect Jens Jensen, the commission hired Prairie School architect William Drummond to design the Shedd Park fieldhouse. In 1928, the firm of Michaelsen & Rognstad designed a gymnasium addition, well incorporated with the original Prairie-style building.  "

  "history": "The West Park Commission created Sheridan Park between 1912 and 1914 to provide breathing space and social services to the congested near west side. The commission's first three neighborhood parks, Dvorak, Eckhart, and Stanford, were so successful that the State passed a bill permitting additional parks in 1909. (Stanford Park no longer exists.) Focusing particularly on programming for children, the West Park Commission often referred to these as \"playground parks.\" The Special Park Commission identified several potential sites for new \"playground parks\" including a small 3.5-acre area adjacent to the existing Jackson School. Jens Jensen, then serving as West Park System consulting landscape architect, created the park's original plan which included swimming and wading pools, and a natatorium, playgrounds, a running track, and an athletic field. The commissioners decided that due to the proximity of the school, which had both an assembly hall and gymnasium, no fieldhouse was necessary in Sheridan Park. Over the years, the school facilities proved to be inadequate, and in 1977 the Chicago Park District constructed a large fieldhouse in Sheridan Park. The three-story building, similar to the Gill Park fieldhouse on the north side, includes an indoor swimming pool, combination gymnasium and assembly hall, and six classrooms. Because of the building's size and scale, community residents often refer to this as a \"high-rise\" park. The park honors Civil War hero Philip Henry Sheridan (1831-1888). One of the Union Army's most successful cavalry leaders, Sheridan gained widespread fame through Thomas Buchanan Read's poem \"Sheridan's Ride.\" After achieving the rank of Brigadier General in the regular Army in 1864, Sheridan became a 4 star general in 1888. Nineteeth century Chicagoans had special reverence for him because he served as commander of army headquarters here in 1871, and played a significant role in limiting the spread of the Great Fire on the city's south side.

  "history": "Sherman Park was one of ten revolutionary Chicago parks which opened to the public in 1905. The city's population had grown from 300,000 in 1870 to 2 million by 1905, but less than 200 acres of new parkland had been created during that period. The noisy, overcrowded immigrant neighborhoods in the center of the city were far away from the existing parks. South Park Commission superintendent J. Frank Foster envisioned a new type of park that would provide social services as well as breathing spaces to these areas. Nationally renowned landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers and architects Daniel H. Burnham and Co. designed the whole system of new parks. In addition to Sherman Park, these were Ogden, Palmer, Bessemer, and Hamilton Parks, and Russell, Davis, Armour, Cornell and Mark White Squares. (Mark White Square is now known as McGuane Park.) At 60 acres, Sherman Park was one of the largest of the parks. The Olmsted Brothers transformed its low and wet site into a beautiful landscape with a meandering waterway surrounding an island of ballfields. The classically-designed architecture, located at the north end of the park, includes the fieldhouse and gym and locker buildings united by trellis-like structures known as pergolas. This architectural commission was especially meaningful to Burnham because the park was named for his father-in-law, John B. Sherman (1825- 1902). The founder of Chicago's Union Stock Yards, Sherman served as a member of the South Park Commission for 25 years. "

By 1935, the enlarged park included a playing field, a baseball diamond, a sand box, and a shelter house. The city transferred Sherwood Park to the Chicago Park District in 1959. Having constructed an above-ground swimming pool and a fieldhouse around 1970, the park district expanded the park slightly in 1976 and again in 1997.

Beginning in 1836, Edward, a northeasterner, and Laura, a former Joliet school teacher, farmed the land now bordered by Armitage, North, Central Park, and Kedzie Avenues. The Simons Park name was suggested by Almira Simons Winkleman's two daughters during the park's development just after World War I. The Fullerton Avenue Business Men's Association had proposed creation of a neighborhood park in 1916, but no action was taken until after the war. The area's Northwest Park District, one of 22 park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934, made its first purchase of land for the park in 1920. Eight years later, the Northwest Park District constructed a red-brick, Second Empire-style fieldhouse designed by nationally-known architect W.W. Alschlager. The fieldhouse, similar to Alschlager's fieldhouses at nearby Kelvyn and Riis Parks, was remodelled in 1990. "

In 1959, the city transferred the property to the Chicago Park District, which rehabilitated the site with a new soft surface playground in 1992. Originally known as 28th Place Playlot for an adjacent street, the park was officially renamed Sintic Park in 1993. The park honors Sergeant Gregory J. Sintic (1947-1968), a U.S. Army enlistee killed by a land mine explosion in Vietnam on January 28, 1968. Sintic was awarded the Bronze Star of Valor and the Purple Heart for his sacrifice.

  "history": "In 1848, as the Illinois and Michigan Canal Trustees prepared sale maps for public land to generate revenue that would be used to build the canal, they set aside a 5 \u00bd acre parcel on what was then the West Side of Chicago to create a small park. Originally named Jefferson Park, the City\u2019s Bureau of Public Works soon improved the small square with lawn trees and a small lake as its centerpiece. Theodore Dreiser described the park in his famous novel, Sister Carrie. In this influential work (which was considered immoral at the time) G.W. Hurstwood, a married man, waited for his mistress Carrie Meeber, while she \"... found a rustic bench beneath the green leaves of a lilac bush.... \u00a0At a little pond nearby some cleanly dressed children were sailing white canvas boats. \u00a0In the shade of a green pagoda a bebuttoned officer of the law was resting, his arms folded.\" During Chicago\u2019s earliest history, the neighborhood surrounding Jefferson Park was one of Chicago\u2019s most fashionable areas. After the Great Fire of 1871, however, the residential area began to decline, and the park also slowly deteriorated. The City transferred the site to the West Park Commission in 1885, and the commission substantially improved the small park a few years later. \u00a0By the 1910s, many other west side parks had facilities specifically for children, and in 1915 a group of local residents petitioned for a children's playground, wading pool, natatorium, and outdoor gymnasium. \u00a0As this project would have required filling in the park's lake, the commissioners decided not pursue it at that time. In 1934, when the West Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District, the park became known as the \u201cthe first Jefferson Park\u201d because the park district also took possession of another site named Jefferson Park on the city\u2019s Northwest side. The first Jefferson Park remained unchanged until 1955, when it was renamed in honor of the adjacent Mark Skinner School. One of Chicago\u2019s earliest school inspectors, Mark Skinner (1836-1887) went on to serve as a U.S. attorney for Illinois, and a State Representative. Soon after its renaming, the park\u2019s lake was filled to make way for ball fields and a playground, to better serve adjacent what is now known as Skinner West Classical Elementary School. In the mid 1970s, Whitney Young Magnet High School opened just southwest of the park. Over the years, adjacent streets were greened over, and Skinner Park was expanded to slightly more than 7 acres in size. Recent improvements include a new playground with a climbable created by Phil Schuster and Jennifer Gotowski and the Chicago Public Art Group.  "

  "history": "In 1929, when a large city dump in the West Town neighborhood had been completely filled, the Bureau of Sanitation transferred part of the site to the Bureau of Parks and Recreation. The city soon named it the Smith Athletic Field for Joseph Higgins Smith, alderman of the surrounding 32nd ward from 1914 to 1933. (At the time, the city regularly named parks for standing aldermen of the wards in which the sites were located.) Although it had been named, the park had few improvements until the late 1930s, when the city installed playground equipment, constructed a small brick recreation building, and created an athletic field that was flooded in winter for ice skating. By the late 1950s, a World War II tank and artillery piece had been placed in the park. In 1959, the city transferred Smith Park to the Chicago Park District, along with more than 250 other properties. After making initial improvements, the park district added a spraypool, swimming pool and bath house in the late 1960s. In 1979, a large modern fieldhouse was constructed in Smith Park. Nine years later, the park district dedicated its gymnasium to Tommy Positano, a high school student who had been active at the park, and who received a Junior Citizenship Award posthumously. "

In 1975, the park was officially named for Wendell Smith (1914-1972), for whom a nearby school is also named. A sports reporter for WGN-TV and The Sun-Times, Smith, an African-American, fought for equality for black sportsmen throughout his life. He encountered discrimination early, when he was dropped from a Detroit American Legion sandlot baseball team at 16. He was reinstated only through the intervention of Henry Ford, for whom his father worked as a chef. As a young man, Smith joined the sports staff of the Pittsburgh Courier, the nation's largest African-American weekly. While working at the Courier, Smith played a significant role in breaking the baseball color line by introducing Jackie Robinson to Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, by whom Robinson was recruited. In 1947, Smith came to Chicago, joining the staff of the Chicago American, and becoming the first full-time black sportswriter on a large daily paper. Smith later moved to WGN-TV, where he was the principal evening sports announcer. At the time of his death, Smith was president of the Chicago Press Club. "

  "history": "The South Shore Cultural Center, a 65-acre park with a golf course, tennis courts, a bathing beach, and an impressive building, originated as the South Shore Country Club. In 1905, Lawrence Heyworth, president of the downtown Chicago Athletic Club, envisioned an exclusive club with a \"country setting.\" Heyworth selected unimproved south lakefront property, often used for fishing and duck hunting, for the new country club.

As the club could not yet collect dues, work had to proceed quickly and inexpensively. To this end, members Marshall Field and A. Montgomery Ward lent their store delivery wagons to transport turf, sod, and trees. Mr. Worcester, Vice-President of the Peoples Gas Company, put in lighting for the grounds and clubhouse. Enjoying immediate success and social importance, South Shore Country Club quickly outgrew its facilities. Marshall and Fox were hired to build a new clubhouse, incorporating the original ballroom. Constructed in 1916, the larger and more substantial reinforced concrete building, like the original, was designed in the Mediterranean Revival style. The country club's membership peaked in the late 1950s. Simultaneously, many African-Americans began settling in South Shore. Because the private club excluded black members, it went out of business in the 1970s. In 1974, the Chicago Park District purchased the property to expand its lakefront facilities.

By the turn of the century, however, administrators were concerned about living conditions in congested neighborhoods within their jurisdiction. In an effort to create new playground parks, the commission put forth a successful bond issue in 1907. This allowed the acquisition of land for Stanton and Seward Parks and improvements to Lake Shore Playground, which was already part of the Lincoln Park System. In 1962, the Chicago Park District entered into an agreement with the Board of Education to operate Stanton Park jointly with the adjacent Friederich von Schiller Elemetary School. Two years later, the original Stanton Park fieldhouse was demolished and replaced with a natatorium and swimming facility. The construction of a gymnasium addition in 1971 allowed for additional recreational programming. "

  "history": "In 1996, the Chicago Park District began creating Ellen Gates Starr Park as part of an innovative partnership with the Board of Education. The park district acquired several parcels of land adjacent to Dett Elementary School including closing and greening over part of Maypole Avenue, to create a lovely 1.25-acre site with a playground, gardens, and recreational landscape. The project included a $75,000 donation from Blue Cross/ Blue Shield for the community garden planted by elementary school students. This park was one of the first successes of the Campus Park Program. This innovative cooperative effort between the Chicago Park District, Board of Education, and City of Chicago, eventually resulted the replacement of asphalt with green space and recreational facilities at sites adjacent to more than 100 schools. The Chicago Park District named the park in honor of Ellen Gates Starr in 2004, as part of a system-wide initiative to recognize the achievements of significant Chicago women. Ellen Gates Starr (1859- 1940), an associate and close friend of Jane Addams, was one of the nation\u2019s most important social reformers. Starr and Addams met at the Rockford Female Seminary. After one year, however, Starr did not have the financial means to remain at the Seminary and she left college to become a teacher in 1878. The two women continued their friendship, and in 1888, they traveled to Europe together. In England, Addams visited Thornbee Hall, one of the world\u2019s first settlements, providing social services to people who lived in the slums of East London. After the trip, Starr agreed to help Addams found America\u2019s first settlement, Hull House, which opened on W. Polk Avenue and S. Halsted Street in September\u00a0of 1889. Starr\u2019s interest in the arts resulted in progressive programs at Hull House such as art classes and an art gallery available to the residents of the settlement house, other poor immigrants who lived in the area, as well as Chicago\u2019s cultural elite. Starr\u2019s interest in art also inspired her to found the Chicago Public School Art Society in 1894, and the Chicago Society of Arts and Crafts in 1897. Starr also fought tirelessly for women\u2019s and workers rights, and became particularly involved in helping workers form unions and strike for better pay and improved working conditions. Dett School is approximately 3 miles away from Hull House, where Ellen Gates Starr lived until 1929, when she moved to New York after becoming paralyzed due to a surgical procedure. "

  "history": "In 1970, the Chicago Park District began creating a 1.7-acre park in the Garfield Ridge community, then experiencing tremendous population growth and a shortage of recreational facilities. Purchasing the property using U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds, the park district improved the site in 1973, constructing a playground, a spray pool, a basketball court, and a baseball field. Since 1984, a mobile trailer/fieldhouse has provided space for indoor activities. Several years later, a soft surface playground replaced the original one. In 1976, the park district officially designated the site Stars & Stripes Park. The patriotic name was selected through a Bicentennial Committee contest conducted in the surrounding 23rd Ward. The name makes reference to the American flag, with its red and white stripes and white stars on a field of blue. Each of the stripes represents one of the original thirteen colonies, while the stars signify the nation's fifty states. "

  "history": "In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired a 16.5-acre site in the South Chicago community to develop a new park. Previously part of the US Steel Complex known as South Works, the site was recently transformed into an attractive landscape with natural areas, trees, walking paths and exquisite views of Lake Michigan. The property is edged by remnant elements of the steel industry, most notably a series of enormous concrete ore walls. Located at the juncture between the Calumet River and Lake Michigan, the South Works first opened in the early 1880s. By this time, the surrounding area had already attracted industrial development because of its location near the river, lake, and substantial railroad service that provided excellent opportunities to transport materials and goods. Swedish, Scottish, and German immigrants had settled in the area, and the growing steel industry attracted even larger numbers of residents to the South Chicago area. In 1901, the US Steel Corporation acquired South Works. At the time, well-paying jobs at the industrial complex attracted Italians, Poles, Mexicans, and African-Americans to make the area their home. At its peak, South Works had more than 20,000 employees. It covered an area of 600 acres, much of which was composed of landfill made of molten slag. After South Works began downsizing in the 1970s, the mill closed down in 1992. The City of Chicago and community organizations are championing ambitious redevelopment plans for the area. Officially named as Steelworkers Park by the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners in 2014, the park provides a first step towards realizing these plans. "

  "history": "During the late 1940s and 1950s, as the historic Hyde Park neighborhood began deteriorating, local civic groups organized to promote racial integration, halt urban decay, and preserve the character of the community. In 1956, the Community Conservation Board approved the creation of the Hyde Park-Kenwood Conservation Area. Two years later, the City Council adopted an ambitious urban renewal plan for the area. The city's plan identified seven sites to be cleared and redeveloped as new parks. A two-and-a-half acre property on South Greenwood Avenue was among these. The Chicago Park District acquired the site in 1967, and began developing it as a playlot. Florence Stout (1912-1996), who lived across the street at 5417 South Greenwood Avenue, was a leading force behind the park's creation. Having settled in Hyde Park in 1950, Stout became active in community affairs. She served on the planning committee and the Board of Directors of the Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference and was a leader of the local block club. Stout diligently monitored the community to prevent litter and crime problems. \u00a0Upon the request of hundreds of local residents, the park district officially named this playlot in honor of Florence Stout in 1998.

Strohacker (1909-1957), along with fellow firefighters George L. Donovan (1916-1957) and Sylvester L.

Strohacker Park lies a mile north and 1.5 miles west of the battalion chief's former home at 6129 South Artesian. Originally known as 55th Street Playfield and Kostner Park for two boundary streets, the park was established on Board of Education property around 1945. The City of Chicago's Bureau of Parks and Recreation managed the park, with its outdoor athletic facilities and small fieldhouse, until 1959, when it was transferred to the Chicago Park District.

Most of the more than 100 species of sumacs are found in southern Africa. At least two sumacs, the staghorn sumac and the poison sumac, may be found in the Chicagoland area. The staghorn sumac takes its name from its thick, wooly twigs, which in winter give the appearance of deer antlers in velvet. The oils of the poison sumac can cause serious rashes. Poison sumacs can be identified using the \"black spot\" test. The oil from a fresh leaf crushed on white paper will gradually turn the paper brown and then black within 24 hours. "

Following its general practice, the bureau named the park for adjacent Summerdale Avenue. Summerdale was a 19th-century village in what later became the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago. Early real estate developer Louis E. Henry gave the name to a street in his subdivision. In 1959, the city transferred Summerdale Park to the Chicago Park District along with more than 250 other properties.

  "history": "Around 1912, when rents began to climb in Chicago's original Chinese settlement on South Clark Street, the Armour Square neighborhood quickly became the second home to the city's Chinese population. The On Leong tong (\"benevolent association\") helped to relocate community residents by arranging long-term leases for its members around 22nd Street (Cermak Road) and Wentworth Avenue. The new China Town has provided a gateway for Chinese immigrants to the midwest ever since. Construction of the Dan Ryan and Stevenson Expressways in the 1950s left scars on China Town and other parts of the Armour Square neighborhood. To compensate for razing two small parks to make room for the highways, the city began developing a strip of vacant land alongside the Stevenson as a new park for China Town. After Neighborhood Redevelopment Assistance, Inc., purchased and donated the property to the city in the mid-1970s, the site was improved with trees, a small pool, a playground, a sandbox, and permanent game tables. The Chicago Park District began leasing the park in 1975, and took full ownership in 1977. Recent improvements include a soft surface playground. In 1977, the park was officially named the Sun Yat Sen Children's Park in honor of Sun Yat Sen (1866-1925), a Chinese revolutionary and statesman. Known as the father of modern China, Sun was born in southern China's Kwangtung province and educated in Western schools in Hawaii and Hong Kong. As a young man, Sun became disillusioned with the ruling Ch'ing dynasty, and began plotting a Chinese revolution in the late 1800s. Sun played a pivotal role in overthrowing the Manchus in 1911, and served as China's first provisional president in 1911-1912. As the leader of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), he also acted as the nation's de facto ruler from 1923 to 1925. In 1977, the District 300 of Lions International and the Republic of China donated a bust of Sun Yat Sen that further underscores his efforts to bring freedom and democracy to China. "

  "history": "By an overwhelming majority, residents of the Ravenswood Manor and Ravenswood Gardens neighborhoods voted to create their own independent park district in 1914. Although these were comfortable, middle-class neighborhoods, the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Park District had limited resources because it could collect no more than 3% of the assessed property valuation within its 1/4-mile territory. The new park district could only afford to create very small parks which emphasized landscape improvements, rather than recreational facilities. In 1917, the Ravenswood Manor Gardens Park District began acquiring .16-acres of land, just east of the North Branch of the Chicago River on Sunnyside Avenue. The following year, the site was transformed into a lovely garden with a central sunken lawn edged by a walk, three trellis-like pergolas, an ornamental fountain, urns, and lush shrubbery and floral plantings. This soon became known as Sunken Gardens Park. In 1934, Sunken Gardens Park became part of the Chicago Park District, which formed through the consolidation of the city's 22 independent park agencies. Although the park district planted more than 300 new shrubs in the late 1930s, Sunken Gardens Park soon suffered from deterioration and vandalism. Unfortunately, by the early 1950s, all of the original garden features had been removed. Today, Sunken Gardens Park is one of 46 park properties used only for passive recreation. "

  "history": "Taylor Park in Bronzeville sits on West 47th Street, at the heart of the former Robert Taylor Homes, once the nation's largest public housing project. The Chicago Housing Authority developed the Taylor Homes in the early 1960s, cutting a wide swath along the western edge of Bronzeville, Chicago's historic \"Black Metropolis.\" The housing complex, designed by Shaw, Metz, and Associates, included a substantial community building with various meeting rooms and a combination gymnasium and assembly hall. In 1962, the CHA began to lease this community building, along with 7.5 acres surrounding it, to the Chicago Park District. The following year, the park district installed tennis courts, a playground, and extensive plantings on the property. In 1967, CHA sold a small portion of the land to the park district, which in turn constructed a new swimming pool there. The park and the surrounding housing complex honor Robert Rochon Taylor (1890--1959), the first African-American to head the CHA. Born in Tuskegee, Alabama, Taylor obtained a graduate degree in architecture from Howard University. Relocating to Chicago, he began building small, affordable homes for blacks. His work soon drew the attention of Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears and Roebuck and one of Chicago's foremost philanthropists. In 1929, Taylor helped Rosenwald and Rosenwald's nephew, fellow architect Ernest A. Grunsfeld, Jr., plan the Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments, the city's first low-income housing complex for African-Americans. Taylor managed the Michigan Boulevard development until his death in 1959. Taylor's work on the Michigan Boulevard development led to his appointment to the CHA board of directors, on which he served from 1938 to 1950. He became CHA chairman in 1943. "

  "history": "The New City community grew up around Chicago's world-renowned Union Stock Yards, founded in 1865. By the first decades of the 20th century, the stock yards and related industries had brought successive waves of immigrant laborers into the neighborhood. New City's population reached 92,659 in 1920. In 1922, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation decided to establish a much-needed park in the northeast corner of the neighborhood. However, condemnation proceedings delayed development for more than five years. Finally, in 1928, the bureau improved the site with a gravel-surfaced playground and ball diamond, an oval wading pool with a pergola shelter, and a small office building with open sand court wings. In the years following World War II, the building wings were enclosed to create a year-round recreational building, and the wading pool was converted to a spray pool. In 1959, the city transferred the park to the Chicago Park District, along with more than 250 other properties. After paving the playground in 1964, the park district made more extensive improvements in the late 1980s and 1990s, constructing a soft surface playground and enclosing the park with ornamental fencing. The park and adjacent Graham Elementary School are jointly operated by the park district and the Board of Education. The park was long known as Boyce Field. In September, 1976, the park district renamed the site Taylor-Lauridsen Park at the request of numerous community groups and organizations. The park's new name honors highly-regarded neighborhood residents John Taylor and Emil Lauridsen, who were murdered on March 13, 1976 after stepping in to help a 15-year-old who was being attacked by four assailants.

  "history": "Throop Park is one of many small city parks created to meet the growing recreational demands of post-World War II Chicago. The city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation developed this Lower West Side park on Board of Education-owned property in the late 1940s, improving it with a gravel-surfaced playground and a spray pool. Within a few years, a basketball court was added. The Chicago Park District began managing Throop Park in 1959. In 1976, the park district thoroughly rehabilitated the site, building a shelter, enhancing the plantings, and constructing bleachers around the resurfaced basketball court. The Board of Education formally transferred the property to the park district in 1990. Subsequent improvements included a soft surface playground and ornamental fencing. In 1998, the park district enlarged the park by expanding into an adjacent vacant. Both the park and adjacent Throop Street bear the name of Amos Gager Throop, one of Chicago's most prominent early citizens. Born in New York, he came west to Michigan in 1832, where he worked in the forests and saw mills. By 1845, he owned enough land to begin shipping lumber to Chicago and the frontier beyond. He and his brother John Eaton Throop opened their first lumber yard at Wells and South Water (now West Wacker) Street. The brothers soon became Chicago's leading lumber merchants. During the Civil War years, Amos Throop was instrumental in developing an extensive system of docking slips along the South Branch of the Chicago River for the city's rapidly-expanding lumber industry. Throop served as a Chicago alderman from 1849 to 1853, and again from 1876 to 1880. Between the two terms, he was city treasurer in 1860-1861, moving on to the state legislature, where he worked to keep southern Illinois loyal to the Union cause. "

  "history": "After 1900, the West Garfield Park community became a magnet for upwardly-mobile first- and second-generation immigrants, primarily Irish, but also, increasingly, of Russian-Jewish descent. West Garfield Park's population topped 40,000 in 1920. To serve the needs of the growing community, the City of Chicago established a new park on Board of Education-owned property along North Kostner Avenue in 1926. By 1928, the site had playground equipment and plantings, and a small, tile-roofed recreational building, which sat at the back of the site. The structure faced a gravel-surfaced playing field that could be flooded for ice skating in winter. The Chicago Park District began leasing the park from the Board of Education in 1959, gaining full ownership in 1991. Several years before, in 1987, the park district had thoroughly rehabilitated the park with new plantings, playground equipment, a jogging path, and resurfaced basketball courts. The park honors George W. Tilton (1830-1890), for whom a nearby school is also named. Born in Manchester, New Hampshire, Tilton came to west Aurora, Illinois in 1858 to work for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. He eventually moved on to Chicago and the Northwestern Railroad, rising through the ranks to become superintendent of the motive power and machine repair division of the entire Northwestern line. In that position, he designed a locomotive that bears his name. Ironically, Tilton died as the result of a train accident in 1890. "

  "history": "The Chicago Park District acquired the site for Ping Tom Memorial Park in 1991. For years, its surrounding Chinatown community had suffered a total lack of open space and recreational facilities. The only nearby parks, Hardin Square and Stanford Park, had been demolished 30 years earlier to make way for the Dan Ryan Expressway. Two full generations of children in Chinatown grew up without access to a neighborhood park or any recreational area. Ping Tom Memorial Park's 12-acre site was originally a Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad yard located along the edge of the South Branch of the Chicago River. In 1998, the Chicago Park District began transforming the old rail-yard into a beautiful rolling green space, taking full advantage of impressive river views. The park has a children's playground, community gathering areas, and Chinese landscape design elements. The park was named in honor of the leading force behind its creation, Chinatown's most noted civic leader, Ping Tom (1935-1995). A lifelong resident of Chinatown, Ping Tom formed the Chinese American Development Corporation in 1984. The private real estate firm transformed a 32-acre rail yard site into Chinatown Square, a $100 million dollar residential and commercial expansion of Chinatown. Active in numerous prominent civic and cultural institutions, Ping Tom was also an advisor to U.S. senators, Illinois governors, and Chicago mayors. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired 5 additional acres on the northeast side of the park. Landscape improvements to the expanded area of Ping Tom Memorial Park will soon follow. "

  "history": "Soon after World War II, the Chicago Park District began a major initiative to create new parks for the first time in many years. This Ten Year Plan identified 43 sites in undeveloped areas which were starting to boom and neighborhoods with few existing parks. In 1948, the district acquired 6.35 acres in Rogers Park, which was among the city's neighborhoods most in need of open space and recreational facilities. Due to the flurry of new construction at the time, Touhy Park was not completed until 1954. In the 1960s, the park district built an addition converting the original comfort station into a fieldhouse. In 1990, separate soft surface playgrounds for older children and tots were added. The park and nearby Touhy Avenue pay tribute to Captain Patrick L. Touhy (1839-1911) one of the founders of the Village of Rogers Park. An Irish immigrant who ran a grocery store in Chicago, Touhy married Catherine Rogers, daughter of the area's first white settler, Philip Rogers, in 1865. Several years later, when Catherine inherited hundreds of acres of land, Touhy began developing Rogers Park. Along with a group of other early settlers, he soon established the Rogers Park Building and Land Company. Formally incorporated as a village in 1878, Rogers Park was annexed to Chicago in 1893, and is now among the city's most diverse neighborhoods. "

  "history": "In 1917, the Chicago City Council authorized the purchase of land at the corner of West Adams and South Hoyne Streets. By 1928, the city had acquired enough additional property to create Touhy-Herbert Park, constructing a playing field, a skating pond and an office building/shelter house. Twenty years later, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation built a fieldhouse there. In 1959, the city transferred the park to the Chicago Park District, which purchased additional land to expand the park to its current 8 acres. Since 1961, the park district and the Board of Education have jointly operated the park and the adjacent Herbert Elementary School. As early as 1930, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation referred to this site as Touhy Park, a name that recognized the public service of local resident John J. Touhy (1888-1974). Touhy served as a city alderman from 1917 until 1926, when he was elected a trustee of the Sanitary District of Chicago. In 1950, he left the Sanitary District to become a Cook County Commissioner. Touhy retired from office in 1970. In 1999, the Chicago Park District officially designated the site Touhy-Herbert Park, a name commonly used by neighbors. The new name, of course, mirrors that of the nearby school, which honors American musician, composer, and conductor Victor Herbert (1859-1924).

  "history": "In the early 1940s, the City of Chicago purchased land in the near north side Lincoln Park neighborhood for creation of a 44th Ward Recreation Center. The city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation transformed a two-story brick rowhouse into a community center, naming it the Robert Trebes Recreation Center on March 18, 1943. Within a few years, the bureau had constructed a spray pool, a sand box, and two playing fields on adjacent property to the south. In the late 1950s, the Trebes Recreation Center was demolished, along with the other structures on the block. In 1958, the Board of Education began constructing the new Oscar Mayer Elementary School on the northern half of the block. The Trebes Park property also passed into the hands of the Board of Education; however the Chicago Park District began maintaining the park the following year. The Park District and the Board of Education soon began joint operations at the school and park, an arrangement that continues today. In 1991, the Board of Education transferred full ownership of Trebes Park to the Park District. The Sheffield Neighborhood Association, in conjunction with the Park District, led the community effort to renovate the park. In the early 1990's, funded projects include tree planting around the perimeter parkways, installing an iron ornamental \"prairie style\" fence, the ornamental metal park benches, garbage containers, walkway lights and installing the ornamental iron gazebo in the park plaza entrance. At that time, the Park District constructed a soft surface playground. The new playground was funded through a generous bequest of Dorothy Melamerson, a retired local school teacher whose savings have paid for a number of park improvements in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, the Sheffield Neighborhood Association and community neighbors. In addition, the Sheffield Neighborhood Association has raised funds for the numerous improvements to the park. Taking personal pride in their local park volunteers have spent thousand of hours in gardening and other greening initiatives.

  "history": "The South Park Commission began creating Trumbull Park in 1907, two years after its revolutionary system of neighborhood parks opened to the public. Initially including Russell, Mark White, Davis, Armour, and Cornell Squares, and Bessemer, Ogden, Sherman, Palmer, and Hamilton Parks, the system was an immediate success. By 1907, the commissioners were attempting to complete eight new parks: four that had been delayed when the first ten opened and four additional parks. One of the areas targeted for a new neighborhood park was South Deering, then known as Irondale for its proximity to a large steel mill complex. The South Park Commission acquired 18.5 acres there adjacent to densely- populated tenements. (These were replaced in 1936 by a Chicago Housing Authority project known as Trumbull Park Homes.) The South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers, landscape designers of the previous neighborhood parks, to lay out the four new parks in 1910. They chose not to implement these plans, however. Rather, they had in-house designers create a single plan for both Trumbull and Grand Crossing Parks. The plans differed only in that their orientation was reversed. Today, the two landscapes look somewhat different because only Trumbull Park retains a magnificent stand of gingko trees in its central plaza. The two parks do have identical classically-designed fieldhouses that were constructed in 1914. Although residents of Irondale petitioned to have Trumbull Park named South Deering Park, the request was denied. In 1917, the commissioners named the park for Lyman Trumbull (1813-1896), a lawyer, Illinois Supreme Court chief justice, U.S. senator, and active supporter of the emancipation of slaves. "

  "history": "In 1907, Senator Clark of the 13th District presented petitions to the South Park Commission requesting the creation of a park in Dauphin Park, now part of the Chatham neighborhood. Annexed to Chicago in 1889 as part of the Town of Lake and Village of Hyde Park, the neighborhood had much open land used for truck farming, trap shooting, and duck hunting, and some frame homes built by railroad workers. The South Park Commission was pleased with the recent success of ten revolutionary neighborhood parks which included year-round recreational facilities, educational programs, and social services. The Commissioners agreed to the request, and began efforts to create Tuley, along with Trumbull, Grand Crossing, and Mann Parks. While acquiring 20 acres of land between 1909 and 1911, the South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers, landscape designers of the previous neighborhood parks, to lay out the four new parks. Development was slow, however, and Tuley Park's original plan was never executed. Although the commission fenced the park, constructed walks, and installed ball fields that were flooded in winter for ice skating, Tuley Park was left unfinished until the 1920s. At that time, the surrounding neighborhood became more populated, and tennis courts, a swimming pool, and a Spanish Revival-style fieldhouse were constructed in the park. The South Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Originally known as Burnside Park for the adjacent Burnside community area, Tuley Park was officially named in honor of Murray F. Tuley (1827-1905) in 1922. Tuley was a circuit court judge who was instrumental in framing the Chicago City Charter adopted after the Great Fire of 1871. "

Three years later, Jens Jensen, then working as gardener, planted an experimental wildflower garden called the American Garden, marking the beginnings of his venerable naturalistic style. In the 1910s, African-Americans began moving into the neighborhood. While many other parks were inaccessible to black residents, Union Park became racially integrated. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, the park became well-known for cultural and social events, and a number of notable musicians performed there.

By 1987, neighborhood residents had again banded together, this time to form \"Citizens for a Decent Playlot.\" The park district began working with the community group to develop a plan for upgrading the park with additional playground equipment and plantings. Improvements were completed in part through the \"sweat equity\" contributions of residents, who also pledged to keep the park clean and crime-free. The rehabilitation was a great success, and the park became a haven for neighborhood children. Unfortunately, some urban problems persisted in an adjacent city parking lot. In the late 1990s, further cooperation between the city, the park district, and Logan Square residents led to the transformation of that parking lot into an attractive three-quarter-acre expansion for Unity Park. The Chicago Park District installed a new playground in the park.\u00a0 Unity Park's name recognizes the persistent efforts of the diverse Logan Square community in making the park a reality. "

  "history": "In 1970, the Chicago Park District identified the under-served southwest side Clearing neighborhood for park development. That year, Clearing's population had peaked at 24,560, a 77% increase over a decade before. In 1972, the park district acquired a 6.46-acre property between West 59th Street and the Indiana Belt Railroad, using U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds. Preliminary park plans, developed in 1973, called for volleyball, tennis, basketball, horseshoe, and shuffleboard courts, an athletic field, a sandbox, and playground equipment. In 1976, the site was officially designated Valley Forge Park in recognition of the nation's Bi-Centennial. On the west bank of Pennsylvania's Schuylkill River, Valley Forge was the Revolutionary War encampment site of General George Washington and 11,000 troops beginning in December 1777. Having been defeated at nearby Brandywine and Germantown, the Continental Army endured an unusually harsh winter at Valley Forge, suffering bitter cold and near-starvation. After weeks of drilling by Baron Frederick von Steuben and an influx of money for supplies in the late spring, the Army emerged in June 1778 as a well-disciplined fighting force ready to press the Revolution forward. Around 1980, the park district brought in a double-wide trailer to be used as a fieldhouse. For many years, the westernmost portion of the property remained unimproved. The park district considered selling that section of the park, but had given up the idea by the early 1990s. Finally, in 1996, the west end of the park was improved with a soccer field. In 1998, the park district expanded the park to 7.74 acres by purchasing land to the east. Future plans call for a new state-of-the-art fieldhouse. "

  "history": "On March 10, 1954, the Chicago City Council decided to honor veterans of the United States armed forces by naming a new southside park Veteran's Memorial Park. This tribute was a natural extension of the patriotic attitude that prevailed across the country during and after World War II. Developed by the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation the previous year, the four-acre park was intended to meet the increasing recreational needs of the South Deering community, whose population had nearly doubled between 1940 and 1950. Initial improvements included outdoor athletic facilities, a playground, and a small brick recreational building. In 1959, the city transferred Veterans' Memorial Park, along with more than 250 other properties, to the Chicago Park District. The park district installed a spray pool in 1966 and a new soft surface playground in 1989. "

Like its relative the pansy, the tiny violet grows in a variety of colors: reddish-purple, blue, white, yellow, and gold. Napoleon Bonaparte gained the nickname \"Corporal Violet\" as his reign as emperor came to an end. Banished to the Island of Elba in 1914, he predicted he would \"return with the violets.\" During his absence, Napoleon's followers identified one another by asking, \"Do you like violets?\" When Napoleon returned to France in late March, 1815, the violets were in fact in full bloom, and Napoleon laid violets on Empress Josephine's grave before being exiled to St. Helena.

  "history": "The Chicago Park District began creating Vittum Park in 1947 as part of the Ten Year Park Development Plan. During the post-World War II period, Chicago's booming population was severely underserved in terms of parkland and facilities. The plan identified areas in critical need of new parks as well as existing parks with inadequate recreational facilities. As part of the expansion effort, the park district acquired a 13-acre property in the Garfield Ridge area. In 1961, the park district transferred a small area of the park, less than one acre in size, to the Board of Education, allowing for the construction of Frank Baum Elementary School. Despite the adjacent school, Vittum Park did not have sufficient indoor facilities until the park district constructed its fieldhouse in 1981. The park honors Harriet Elizabeth Vittum (1872 -1953), an important social reformer heralded as the \"First Lady of the needy.\" In 1904, Vittum began volunteering at the Northwestern University Settlement House, one of Chicago's innovative community centers that provided housing and services to underprivileged neighborhoods. Three years later, Vittum became the facility's administrator. Remaining involved with the settlement house for forty years, she established nutrition clinics, educational programs, and children's summer camps. Vittum received a 1948 Distinguished Service Award from the Chicago Recreation Commission that cited her as \"an illustrious pioneer in the settlement...

  "history": "New City's Wagner Park pays tribute to 14th Ward Alderman Clarence P. Wagner (1904-1953), who died at the height of his career in 1953. Wagner, a 1925 graduate of DePaul University Law School, practiced law before entering the political arena. Wagner became an assistant Probate Court judge in 1935. He was elected to the City Council in 1943, and named Council Finance Committee Chairman in 1950. A powerful political force, he was sometimes called the city's \"unofficial mayor.\" Just days before his fatal car accident, Wagner had temporarily blocked then County Clerk Richard J. Daley from ascending to the office of Cook County Democratic Chairman. Wagner Park was established by the City of Chicago, which began to purchase land for the park in 1949. By 1953, the city had acquired two non-contiguous properties along 51st Street. The Bureau of Parks and Recreation planned a lawn with walkways and plantings on the eastern parcel, and a playground, volley ball courts, and a shelter house on the western parcel. The city transferred Wagner Park and more than 250 other properties to the Chicago Park District in 1959. In subsequent years, the park district removed the shelter house, installed a new spray pool, and rehabilitated the playground. Unusual among Chicago's parks, the two Wagner Park properties remain separated by private property. "

  "history": "In 2010, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners officially named Park 511 (previously nicknamed Erie Park) in honor of Aaron Montgomery Ward, Chicago\u2019s famous mail order entrepreneur who became known as the \u201cWatchdog of the Lakefront.\u201d Its site at 630 N. Kingsbury Street is only a few short blocks away from the Montgomery Ward & Co. Catalog House Building at 600 N. Chicago Avenue. Born in New Jersey, Aaron Montgomery Ward (1843- 1913) grew up in Niles, Michigan where he attended public schools. As a teenager, he began as a factory worker earning 25 cents a day and then became a day laborer at a brickyard. Settling in Chicago in 1865, he worked for Field, Palmer & Leiter (later Marshall Field & Co.) and then for another Chicagodepartment store known as CW Partridge. In 1872, A. Montgomery Ward founded the world\u2019s first large mail order house in the world, operating from a loft over a livery stable on Kinzie Street between Rush and State Streets. He went on to become one of the nation\u2019s most successful businessmen with the catalog house on N. Chicago Avenue and the company\u2019s headquarters located from two buildings on Michigan Avenue at Madison Street. Ward\u2019s Michigan Avenue office overlooked Lake Park (later renamed Grant Park). By the 1880s the park had garbage heaps, livery shacks, an unsightly maintenance yard, and the City regularly leased out space there to Barnum and other circuses. A. Montgomery Ward filed an injunction to prohibit the city from dumping garbage, maintaining sheds and shacks, and holding circuses there. This proved to be the first in a long series of legal measures he took to preserve the lakefront park. Daniel H. Burnham developed plans proposing several buildings in the center of Grant Park including a new Field Museum and Crerar Library. Aware that early restrictions that deemed the site as a \u201cPublic Ground\u2026 forever open, clear and free of any buildings or obstructions whatever,\u201d Ward continued his battle to protect the lakefront open space. Vilified by the media and government officials, public opinion regarding Ward\u2019s efforts was generally negative. He once said, \u201cI have nothing at stake in this fight but the good of the people now for future generations. Perhaps I may see the public appreciate efforts, but I doubt it.\u201d Ward won his final court challenge in 1910 and is revered today for his battle to protect Chicago's lakefront. "

  "history": "Warren Park was created in the 1970s, born of both conflict and cooperation. The controversy began in 1965 when real estate developers offered to purchase the 94-acre private Edgewater Golf Club for $7.6 million from its members. Soon after the community learned that the buyers wanted to build high-rise apartments and a large shopping center on the site, a coalition of local groups known as the Allied North Side Community Organizations launched a major campaign to save the land as open space. Despite the strong community objection, however, the City re-zoned the site in 1968 to allow development to move forward. When the city failed to support the park scheme, the commuity groups solicited the support of the State Government. In 1969, Governor Ogilvie signed a bill to make the private golf course into a state park. The governor announced that this would be \"the first major state park in Illinois created in an urban area. By bringing a park to the people, instead of requiring them to go to a distant park, we shall mark an historic turning point in the battle to preserve open lands.\" The State of Illinois acquired approximately one-third of the property for $8 million the following year. In 1971, the state officially named the park in honor of Laurence C. Warren (1923-1970), a key figure in the fight to save the golf course as open space. The son of German Jewish immigrants, Warren was a succesful attorney and community leader. He was a past president of the North Town Community Council, and chairman of the Allied North Side Community Orgnizations. Governor Ogilvie said \"while the new name of this great urban park memorializes a single community leader, it symbolizes the remarkable partnership that saved most of the former club for the public.\" Despite the progress in creating a state park, plans to develop the remaining golf course acreage continued, and community opposition stayed strong. To save the rest of the golf course land as open space, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners agreed to condemn the remaining 32-acre site in 1972. The state transferred its property to the park district in 1975. In the late 1970s, the Chicago Park District began a major construction project for the park which included a field house, playground, ball fields, and a nine-hole golf course. In 1980, Warren Park's golf course was officially dedicated in honor of Robert A. Black (1896-1978), Chief Engineer to the Chicago Park District for more than thirty years. "

Originally considered the \u201cwestern division\u201d\u2014a 367-acre portion of the enormous 1055-acre South Park\u2014it was connected to the park\u2019s \u201ceastern division\u201d via a grand boulevard called the Midway Plaisance. In 1881, the South Park Commissioners named the western division in honor of George Wash\u00adington (1732\u20131799) first president of the United States. At the same time, they named the eastern division Jackson Park. Olmsted and Vaux completed an ambitious plan for South Park in 1871. The plan included a magnificent South Open Green- an open meadow on which cows and sheep would roam to enhance the pastoral experience and keep the lawn trim. The meadow was not only enjoyed by flocks of Southdown sheep, but also park patrons who gathered for baseball, drills, and other athletics.\u00a0 Renowned architects Burnham & Root designed two late nineteenth century buildings in the park\u2014the stables and round house and the refectory which originally housed the offices for the South park Commissioners.\u00a0 In 1910 Burnham\u2019s firm designed a larger administrative headquarters which houses the Du Sable Museum of African American History. In 1922 Lorado Taft (1860\u20131936), Chicago\u2019s pre-eminent sculptor, created the Fountain of Time on the southeastern edge of Washington Park. Inspired by \u201dThe Paradox of Time,\u201d a poem by Henry Austin Dobson, Taft\u2019s fountain is composed of an ominous cloaked Father-Time figure gazing at a wave-like procession of one hundred human figures across the water. By the mid-1930s, the growing African-American community around Washington Park was in dire need of additional recreational facilities. The park district responded by building two competition-size swimming pools near the refectory. In the early 1990s, the park district rehabilitated the refectory and transformed the swimming area into a major aquatic center. Recent projects include lagoon improvements, the construction of a $700 thousand playground, the creation of an arboretum, and a $2 million restoration of the Fountain of Time.\u00a0 Lagoon improvements were made in the early 2000s.

  "history": "In 2004, Peoples\u2019 Housing, a non-profit organization deeded a .19-acre playlot in the Rogers Park community to the Chicago Park District. The site became #506 on the park district\u2019s facility listing. The playlot was created in 1983, and has been known since then as Harold Washington Tot Lot. Mayor Harold Washington attended the park\u2019s ribbon-cutting 22 years ago. Many area residents still have fond memories of shaking the late Mayor\u2019s hand at the dedication ceremonies. Numerous community members and organizations provided strong support for the proposed name change to Harold Washington Memorial Park. In February 2006, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners approved the name change request. Harold Lee Washington (1922- 1987) was Chicago\u2019s first African-American Mayor, serving from 1983 until his death in 1987.Born and raised on Chicago\u2019s south side, Washington graduated from DuSable High School. After serving in the military, he studied at Roosevelt College, one of the academic institutions in the region that then accepted African-Americans. He served as class president and received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in 1948. He went on to attend Northwestern University School of Law, receiving a law degree in 1952. Washington worked as an assistant city prosecutor and as an arbitrator for the Illinois Industrial Commission. He was active in the Third Ward Democratic Organization and Third Ward Young Democrats. Elected as member of the Illinois House of Representatives in 1965, he served through 1976. He served as Illinois State Senator from 1976 to 1980; and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1980 until 1983. On April 22, 1983, he was elected as Mayor of Chicago, and was re-elected for a second term in 1987. Although his second term was cut short by his untimely death, he accomplished much in City Hall during his tenure. Many of his Executive Orders Ordinances became models for other cities including advisorycommissions on the affairs of Latinos, Women, and Asians; Ordinances on Affirmative Action in employment and procurement, tenants\u2019 rights, campaign finance reform, Freedom of Information and South African divestiture.He served as Chairman of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and put forth an agenda for the re-development of the inner cities, and initiated a national dialogue on race relations. Mayor Harold Washington instituted a public policy and practice of fairness and equality for all of the citizens and communities. This attitude was made clear in his first inaugural address on April 29, 1983, he said, \"I hope to be remembered by history as the Mayor who cared about the people and who was, above all, fair.\u201d "

This park contains tennis courts, picnic areas, a motorboat pond, chess tables and volleyball poles. Popular activities at this park include\u00a0chess, volleyball and soccer. ",
  "history": "In 1906, the City of Chicago acquired a stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline in the Hyde Park community. Noted landscape architect and Special Park Commission member Jens Jensen described the ten-acre site as \"the most valuable\" property within the agency's holdings. Due to severe lakeshore erosion, however, he also pronounced it \"an eyesore...of no value to the public as a place of recreation.\" The following year, the commission implemented Jensen's plans for the new East End Park, installing trees, lawns, walks, and benches. City funds for the desperately-needed shoreline protection were not forthcoming, however, and in late November, 1912, a severe storm destroyed the dilapidated breakwater. Seven years later, the City Council transferred East End Park to the South Park Commission as part of a far-reaching program to develop the south lakeshore and improve passenger service on the Illinois Central Railroad. It was the South Park Commission that finally installed permanent lakeshore protection, and in 1927, East End Park formally became part of the South Park system's Burnham Park. By 1930, the South Park Commission had constructed a wading pool, model yacht harbor, and tennis courts on the former East End property. In 1934, the South Park Commission and 21 other independent park boards were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. For years, the park district made only minor improvements in the former East End Park, concentrating its efforts elsewhere in Burnham Park. In the early 1990s, however, the park district replaced the wading pool with a new spray pool and constructed an elaborate soft surface playground. Officially severing the former East End property from Burnham Park, the park district renamed the site Harold Washington Park in 1992. A lawyer, state legislator, U.S. congressman, and Hyde Park resident, Harold Washington (1922-1987) was also Chicago's first mayor of African-American descent. "

  "history": "In 1842, James Fitch, Orasmua Bushnell, and Charles Butler of the American Land Company donated a three-acre parcel to the city for use as a public park. The donors named the site Washington Square, possibly after a similar park located in an elegant New York City neighborhood. As the developers had hoped, Chicago's Washington Square was soon surrounded by many fine residences and churches. In 1869, the city began improving Washington Square with lawn, trees, bisecting diagonal walks, limestone coping, and picket fencing. By the 1890s, an attractive Victorian fountain adorned the square. Within a decade or so, however, it had been razed and the park had deteriorated. In 1906, when Alderman McCormick became President of Drainage Board, he decided to devote his aldermanic salary to improving the park. McCormick donated a $600 fountain, and the city allocated an additional $10,000 to rehabilitate the park. Landscape improvements were planned by the renowned designer, Jens Jensen, then a member of the board of the city's Special Park Commission. By the 1910s, the neighborhood surrounding Washington Square had become more diverse. Because many old mansions were converted into flophouses, the park earned the nickname, \"Bughouse Square.\" Like Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park, Washington Square became a popular spot for soap box orators. Artists, writers, political radicals, and hobos pontificated, lectured, recited poetry, ranted and raved. A group of regulars formed \"The Dill Pickle Club,\" devoted to free expression. For years Washington Square orators appointed their own honorary \"king.\" In 1959, the city transferred Washington Square to the Chicago Park District. Although Alderman McCormick's fountain was removed in the 1970s, in the late 1990s, the park district, the city, and neighborhood organizations agreed on a restoration plan for Washington Square. Improvements include a reconstructed historic fountain, period lighting, fencing, and new plantings. "

  "history": "One of five parks created by the Lincoln Park Commission and named for a member of President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet, Welles Park honors Gideon Welles (1802-1878), Secretary of the Navy from 1861 to 1869. Since the Lincoln Park Commission's formation in 1869, its primary responsibility was to improve and manage Lincoln Park and its connecting boulevards. By 1908, the commissioners were impressed with new neighborhood parks on Chicago's south and west sides, and began efforts to create similar parks on the city's north side. In 1910, the Lincoln Park Commission transformed an initial 8-acre site into Welles Park. The commissioners began leasing a large property just east of the park in 1922, and several years later they purchased the additional acreage to permanently enlarge Welles Park. A small fieldhouse opened in Welles Park in 1915. This was replaced by a modern facility in 1970. In the 1920s, Abe Saperstein (1902-1966) began his career as a basketball coach in the Welles Park fieldhouse. Saperstein soon recruited south side African-American basketball players to play at a Jewish youth center in the Maxwell Street neighborhood. In 1927, he began coaching a semi-professional black basketball team. Known as the Savoy Big Five, because they played twice a week at the south side Savoy Ballroom. Saperstein soon took the team on the road, driving the players in his own Model T Ford. He renamed the team the Harlem Globetrotters to suggest an all-black travelling team. Saperstein encouraged the players to do trick moves with the basketball, and they became the one of the world's most entertaining and well-known basketball teams. In 1971, Abe Saperstein was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame. "

In 1983, the park district renamed the park in honor of Cook County Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Wendt (1910-1982).

By 1913, the property had passed to the Chicago Baseball League's (later the Negro National League's) American Giants, who erected a 9,000-seat grandstand there. By 1946, the ball field was gone, and the Chicago Housing Authority began building the 422-unit Wentworth Gardens public housing development on the site of the former ball field. The complex included a centrally-located community center to provide a gathering place for residents of the Wentworth Gardens Homes. In 1964, the Chicago Park District began offering recreational programming at the community center on behalf of CHA. In 1968, the agencies formalized the relationship, with the park district signing a lease for use of the community building and more than an acre of surrounding property. The following year, the park district constructed a swimming pool behind the community center. In 1991, the park district provided new recreational opportunities to residents by adding volleyball and basketball courts, a soft surface playground, a jogging path, and a picnic area. Wentworth Gardens Park and the surrounding housing development take their names from adjacent Wentworth Avenue. The street honors John Wentworth (1815-1888), one of Chicago's best-known civic leaders. Born to a prominent family, Wentworth's paternal grandfather was a member of the Continental Congress and his maternal grandfather served as a colonel under George Washington. Almost immediately after arriving from the East in 1836, Wentworth became editor of the Chicago Democrat, and quickly involved himself in the fledgling city's politics. In 1857, and again in 1860, Wentworth was elected to a one-year term as mayor. He later became the city's police chief and also served five consecutive terms in Congress. Considered one of Chicago's most flamboyant politicians, Wentworth was known as \"Long John\" for his six-foot-six, three-hundred-pound physique. "

Before any improvements were made, the Board of Education requested that the northeastern corner of the park be devoted to a new elementary school. The park district sold the property to the board, and began improving the remaining parkland in 1956. By the time the Board of Education constructed John H. Kinzie Elementary School the following year, Wentworth Park included an athletic field; volleyball, basketball, horse shoe, and tennis courts; and a children's playground. The park district added a recreation building and sun deck in 1964. In 1965, the Board of Education built the new Kennedy High School on 56th Street across from Wentworth Park. For years, the park district has provided jointly-operated programs from both of the schools. John Wentworth (1815-1888), a well-known early settler and civic leader, originally owned much of the land located near what became the park.

At the close of World War II, the Chicago Park District initiated a Ten Year Plan to create new parks in under-served and rapidly-growing areas of the city. The western section of Chatham was among the neighborhoods identified for park development. In spring 1948, a group of community residents and the local alderman, William Murphy, appeared before the park board, recommending the site's acquisition. The park district moved swiftly, condemning the property and taking possession by the fall of that year. Because the park district was simultaneously building 43 new parks, initial improvements moved slowly here, but within a few years West Chatham Park had an athletic field and playground equipment.

  "history": "West Lawn Park takes its name from the surrounding community on Chicago's west side. West Lawn dates to 1877, when real estate developers James Webb and John F. Eberhart established the village and its neighbor to the east, Chicago Lawn. Though West Lawn was annexed to Chicago in 1889, the marshy area drew few residents until well into the 20th century. Public improvements were made west of Pulaski Road in the 1930s, and construction of single-family brick residences in West Lawn increased as the Depression gave way to improved circumstances in the World War II years. At the close of the war, the Chicago Park District initiated a Ten Year Plan to increase recreational opportunities in under-served and rapidly-growing areas of the city. West Lawn was among the neighborhoods identified for park development. There was strong community support for creating a park at 65th Street and Keeler Avenue, but property acquisition was delayed until 1948 because the owners wanted to build homes there. Park improvements were also slow to materialize, due to the flurry of construction at other parks throughout the city. General plans were drawn in 1953, and playground equipment was installed the following year. In 1957, the park district constructed a small recreation building, as well as basketball, volley ball, and tether ball courts. Community demands for a wider variety of recreational facilities prompted construction of a substantial new fieldhouse in 1972. More recent improvements include installation of a refrigerated ice skating rink and the replanting of the park's landscape, plus a batting cage. "

  "history": "West Pullman Park was created by the West Pullman Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. In 1891, the West Pullman Land Association began subdividing property southwest of the Pullman Palace Car factory. The West Pullman Park District formed in 1913 to create parks for the developing neighborhood. By that time, the community was filled with steel mills and other industries. Wealthy industrialists lived virtually side by side with eastern and southern European immigrant workers who kept their factories running. To best meet the needs of both populations, the park district concentrated its efforts on establishing a single park that could provide both recreational facilities and social welfare programs. The West Pullman Park District began to acquire property in 1914. By 1915, a one-story brick fieldhouse stood on the new park site. Landscape improvements, including playgrounds, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds, soon followed. Increasing recreational opportunities were accompanied by a range of social welfare programs. Area employers such as the International Harvester and Great Lakes Forge companies actively supported park district efforts to provide civic education and health information to the community's \"underprivileged.\" As early as 1918, the fieldhouse was the site of \"Americanization\" meetings intended to encourage immigrant to embrace the American way of life and become citizens. In 1923, with the cooperation of the Chicago Health Department, the park district opened a welfare station to dispense child care information to area mothers. Throughout the years, West Pullman Park has retained its beautiful natural setting. The site's mature stand of oaks, hickories, and cherries covers an ancient river bank. This wooded slope is one of Chicago's few remaining native landscapes. "

  "history": "In 2015, the Chicago Park District and City of Chicago dedicated Park #568 which is now known as West Ridge Nature Park. The 21-acre site lies at the northwest corner of Rosehill Cemetery. One of Chicago\u2019s oldest burial grounds, Rosehill Cemetery was dedicated in 1859. Landscape gardener William Saunders, a national leader in the Rural Cemetery Movement, created Rosehill Cemetery\u2019s original design which included curving drives, swaths of lawn, and several water features. Through the cemetery\u2019s history, the area at the northwest corner included a pond. Until its recent conversion to parkland, however, the 21-acre site remained an undeveloped part of the cemetery that had never been used for burials. That heavily wooded corner had been used as a dumping ground for excess dirt and debris. After acquiring the site in 2011, the Chicago Park District hired Hitchcock Design Group to create a plan that combines ecological restoration goals with park enhancements. The improvements include a multi-purpose trail that loops throughout the park, boardwalks that cross over environmentally sensitive areas, removal of invasive plants, the addition of more than 500 native trees and shrubs, overlooks and fishing access points. The multi-million dollar project was funded through a combination of federal grants, TIF funds, and Chicago Park District funding. "

  "history": "Western Park is one of many city parks created to meet the growing recreational demands of post-World War II Chicago. After purchasing a small parcel in the West Town neighborhood in 1952, the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation installed playground equipment on gravel surfacing. In 1959, the city transferred the quarter-acre site to the Chicago Park District, along with more than 250 other properties. Having made some improvements to the playground equipment in the 1960s and 1980s, the park district thoroughly rehabilitated the park in 1992, constructing a new soft surface playground and installing border plantings. The park's name recognizes its location on Western Avenue. At 23.5 miles, Western Avenue is Chicago's longest street. This roadway marked formed the western border of the city from 1851 until 1869, when Chicago expanded beyond it. "

By 1972, playground equipment, baseball diamonds, basketball and tennis courts, and plantings surrounded the two structures.In 1990, the park district replanted the landscape and installed a new soft surface playground. Early the following year, the Board of Education formally acquired the property from the park district, which now leases White Park. Both the park and the adjacent school honor American astronaut Edward H. White (1930-1967). Born in San Antonio, Texas, White graduated from the U.S. Military Academy before becoming a fighter pilot. In 1958, he entered the University of Michigan's Air Force Institute of Technology, and four years later became one of nine people chosen to enter NASA's astronaut training program. Several years later, White was chosen to fly the first long-duration space flight. During the June 1965 Gemini IV flight, White became the first American to walk in space. Not long thereafter, NASA officials selected White as senior pilot for the first Apollo mission.

  "history": "In 1870, when businessmen and developers Charles G. and Joel H. Wicker began constructing drainage ditches and laying out streets in their subdivision, they donated a four-acre parcel of land to the city to be used as a public park. Fencing the triangular site to keep cows out, the city created an artificial lake in the center of the park, surrounding it with lawn and trees. As the Wickers had hoped, the area developed into a fashionable middle- and upper-class neighborhood. In 1885, the city transferred Wicker Park to the West Park Commission. Five years later, the West Park Commission filled the park's lake, replacing it with lawn. Between 1892 and 1895, a fanciful fountain was installed in the park. The cut-granite fountain had an outer basin which still exists, lovely ornamentation, and floral urns. In the center was a cast-iron fountain with foliage motifs and small gargoyle faces from which water was sprayed. In 1908, Jens Jensen, then West Park System Superintendent, removed the cast-iron fountain and replaced it with a jet spray, converting the fountain into a children's wading pool. Jensen also built pergolas (trellis-like structures) and planted additional trees and shrubs in Wicker Park. The West Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. To provide additional programs, the park district soon constructed a small fieldhouse in Wicker Park. The building proved inadequate, and the park district replaced it with an attractive post-modern fieldhouse in 1985. Throughout its history, the park has borne the Wicker family name. Having settled in Chicago in 1839, Charles G. and his brother Joel H. opened a wholesale grocery business. Charles went on to own two railroad lines, and to serve as Alderman, Cook County Supervisor, and Illinois State Legislator. "

  "history": "In 1973, the Chicago Park District began creating a small park in the North Center community, at the urging of the Lake View Citizen's Council. Using funds from the Illinois Department of Conservation's Open Space Lands Acquisition Program and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the park district purchased a vacant lot on West Nelson Street. Within a few years, the park district had improved the property with an asphalt-surfaced playground. Further upgrades came in 1989, with the installation of a tree-edged, soft-surface playground. In 2000, the Ravenswood/Lakeview Historical Society requested that this park be named in honor of William A. Wieboldt (1857-1954), founder of an extensive chain of neighborhood department stores. One of its flagship stores, located at the corner of Lincoln and Belmont Avenues, stood less than two blocks from the park site. It was in the Lincoln Belmont store that Wieboldt maintained his office for many years. Born near Cuxhaven, Germany, in 1857, Wieboldt came to Chicago at the age of 14. In 1883, Wieboldt and his wife, Anna Louisa Kruger, used $2,600 in savings to open a general store on Indiana Avenue (now Grand Avenue), near Ashland Avenue. This was the first establishment in what would become a 13-store chain covering the entire Chicago area. Using profits from his successful neighborhood stores, Wieboldt established a philanthropic foundation in 1921. His initial gift of $5 million was a considerable endowment at the time, and Chicago's charitable, civic, and educational organizations have reaped the benefits ever since. "

  "history": "Wildwood Park was created as part of a ten-year initiative by the Chicago Park District to serve the city's booming post-World War II population. In 1949, the park district began purchasing vacant land in the rapidly-growing Forest Glen community, acquiring neighboring city streets and alleys late the following year. That winter, the park district flooded a section of open field to create a temporary ice skating rink. However, no further improvements were made until Wildwood Elementary School was constructed on adjacent property in 1953. Using the school gymnasium for recreational programs during evening hours and on weekends, the park district began joint operations with the Board of Education. Within a few years, Wildwood Park had an athletic field, playground equipment, tennis courts, and a comfort station. Additional improvements, including tree planting, playground rehabilitation, and a new sand volleyball court, came in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wildwood Park and the adjacent school take their names from nearby Wildwood Avenue. All three recognize the heavily wooded nature of the surrounding territory, once a Potawatomi hunting ground. Only a few blocks from the park and school, the Billy Caldwell Forest Preserve cuts through the community. Caldwell, a half-Indian, half-English chief of the Potowatomis, also known as Sauganash, sold most of his land to farmers when his tribe was removed from the area in 1836. Some of Caldwell's former land has been developed into the residential areas of Forest Glen, while a large portion was set aside for the Cook County forest preserve. "

  "history": "During and after World War I, many African-Americans arrived in the Douglas neighborhood from the rural south, and the community soon became the heart of Black Chicago. By the early 1940s, government urban renewal projects led to the demolition of much of the neighborhood's aging housing stock, with large areas of public housing taking its place. Among the new housing projects was the 800-unit Dearborn Homes, opened in 1950. As planning for this complex progressed, the Chicago Housing Authority began working with the Chicago Park District to provide parkland for the new development. The park district purchased more than 6 acres of property from CHA in 1950, awarding contracts for landscape improvements and utilities the following year. Construction of a neighborhood school on adjacent land moved forward simultaneously, and the park district soon began using the school's gymnasium as a fieldhouse in the evenings and on weekends. Over the years, the park district added an athletic field, playground equipment, a small recreation building, a spray pool, and horse shoe, tennis, and basketball courts. A recently-installed interactive waterplay area offers community children relief from Chicago's hot summers. Both the park and the adjacent school bear the name of Dr. Daniel Hale Williams (1856-1931), the pre-eminent African-American surgeon of his time. Having arrived in Chicago in 1880, Williams entered the Chicago Medical College, graduating three years later. Unable to join the staff of any city hospital due to his race, in 1891 Williams founded the predominantly-black Provident Hospital in a three-story building at 29th and Dearborn Streets, just a few blocks from the site of Williams Park and School. Provident offered the country's first nursing school for African-Americans. Not long after founding Provident Hospital, Williams gained international fame for performing the world's first successful open heart surgery in 1893. "

  "history": "Williams \u2013 Davis Park. In 2006, the Chicago Park District acquired a 2.85 acre park from the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) in the Oakland community. The park was created as part of the CHA\u2019s Plan for Transformation which included razing the severely deteriorated public housing units known as Lake Park Homes and replacing them with a mixed income community. Designed by Bauer Latoza Studio, the park includes a playground, passive landscape areas, and a bronze sculpture entitled Restoration that symbolically represents the transformation of the Oakland neighborhood. In 2012, community members suggested two significant women for whom the park should be named, Hattie Kay Williams and Izora Davis. Since both women lived near the park site and devoted their lives to improving the surrounding community, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners decided to name the site in honor of both of them. Hattie Kay Williams Hattie Kay Williams (1922 - 1990) was a social worker and community activist who had an important impact on the city and the nation. As a mother of six small children and married to a postal worker, in the 1950s, Williams heard about the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education case became committed to integrating and improving Oakenwald School in her own neighborhood. At the time, there were only twenty black families living in the area and the school was segregated, with white and minority students divided into morning and afternoon shifts. She became the first African American president of Oakenwald School\u2019s P.T.A., organized fundraisers and programs to better the lives of minority children and within a short time she became president of the Southeast Council PTA, which covered more than 40 schools. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Superintendent Benjamin Willis refused to integrate the Chicago Public Schools, installing sub-standard \u201cWillis Wagons,\u201d rather than renovating and enlarging rundown school buildings. Ms. Williams organized protest rallies and pickets at Willis Wagon locations. She befriended the nationally syndicated columnist Ann Landers who helped garner media attention for the cause of improved facilities and school integration. (This campaign led to Willis\u2019s resignation in 1966). Williams was also responsible for helping to establish a study center that became a Head Start pilot site, a food pantry, rape prevention programs, community services teen mothers, and programs to address domestic and gang violence. Ms. Williams worked professionally for the Welfare Council of Metropolitan Chicago and wrote columns for the Sun-Times. She served on several boards and received many honors including the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation Award, the State of Illinois Governor\u2019s Citation, Alberta Hall Memorial and Humanitarian Award, Operation PUSH\u2019s Giant Parent of Excellence Award, Lambda Kappa Mu Sorority Community Award, and One of the Most Caring People in American Award presented by the Caring Institute in Washington D.C. Izora Davis Izora Davis (1952- 2006) began living in public housing in Chicago in 1983 with her two young children. She studied martial arts and began teaching karate to kids in the projects on Lake Park, often in her apartment or in the schoolyard of Jackie Robinson Elementary school. After living in one of the three horseshoe buildings on Lake Park for less than a year, CHA announced a major plan for closing the buildings, with promises to rehab and reoccupy them. Ms. Davis became a vocal public housing activist. She was instrumental in getting a Memorandum of Accord that gave displaced tenants the right to return to the community they called home should they desire to do so. Her fight became the blueprint for future agreements involving displaced and relocated public housing residents in Chicago. Ms. Davis\u2019s efforts were featured in articles in many newspapers. She served on the board of the Fund for Community Redevelopment and Revitalization. Mary Patillo, author of Black on The Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City included her story in the book. Such attention from key institutions and people as these indicate the notoriety of a woman who did not believe in the notion of giving up on what she held true to her heart. In August of 2006, three weeks prior to Ms. Davis\u2019 death there was a massive blackout that struck the Kenwood area, and the people who lived in Lake Park Place had to be relocated out of the buildings until the electricity could be restored. She fought to make sure people were not ignored and were given cool sanctuary until it was safe to return home, while she herself stayed behind to look out for those who chose not to leave. "

  "description": "The Frank J. Wilson Park is located in the Portage Park\u00a0community (on Milwaukee Avenue, 2 \u00bd blocks south of Lawrence Avenue). The park sits on 8.65 acres and is equipped with a softball field, junior baseball field, playslab with four basketball standards, three tennis courts, two volleyball courts, a water play area, and a playground. The fieldhouse contains an assembly hall with stage, two kitchens, and several clubrooms. ",
  "history": "Wilson Park was created by the Old Portage Park District, one of 22 independent park commissions consolidated into the Chicago Park District in 1934. Established in 1912, the Old Portage District spent years developing its first property, Portage Park. By the mid-1920s, the surrounding Portage Park community had grown considerably, and its far northeastern corner was in need of its own recreational facilities. Residents suggested developing an 8.81-acre property along Milwaukee Avenue, but the Street Railway Company planned to build a car barn there instead. Frank J. Wilson, a former Cook County Commissioner and committeeman for the old 41st Ward, led a successful fight to secure the property as parkland. The park district recognized Wilson's efforts by naming the new park in his honor. The Old Portage Park District began improving Wilson Park with walkways, lawns, and planted areas in 1925. Three years later, a Georgian Revival-style fieldhouse was built along Milwaukee Avenue. The handsome brick building, with its limestone accents and columned portico, is identical to fieldhouses at nearby Shabbona and Chopin Parks. The Wilson Park fieldhouse was soon surrounded by a playground, a putting green, horseshoe and tennis courts, and a sunken lawn for baseball, football, and skating in winter. Soon after acquiring Wilson Park in 1934, the Chicago Park District laid new concrete sidewalks, rehabilitated the landscape, and remodelled the fieldhouse. The building accommodated a wide variety of community activities including lectures, movies, theater productions, club meetings, ping pong, tumbling, wrestling, and social dancing. Significant recent improvements to Wilson Park include a soft surface playground, a sand volleyball court, and an interactive waterplay area. "

Improvements began immediately, and the park soon had a large new fieldhouse. In 1933, the City Council named the new park Wilson Playground in honor of Bridgeport Alderman John P. Wilson (1893-1968). Nearby Wilson Community Center is also named for Alderman Wilson. Wilson served on the City Council from 1925 to 1929, acting as Chairman of council's Committee on Recreation from 1931 to 1933. In 1933, Wilson was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Public Works, a position he held until 1967.

  "history": "In 1928, the City of Chicago decided to purchase property in the Bridgeport neighborhood on which to build a public bath house. This would be the last of the city's 18 municipal bath houses created after 1900 to provide much-needed bathing facilities in crowded working-class neighborhoods. Completed in 1929, the new bath house/community center opened to the public in 1930. The City Council designated the facility the John P. Wilson Bath House. Bridgeport Alderman John P. Wilson (1893-1968), for whom nearby Wilson Park is also named, was instrumental in developing the bath house. Elected alderman in 1925 and again in 1929, Wilson served as chairman of the City Council's Committee on Recreation between 1931 and 1933. In 1933, Wilson became Deputy Commissioner of Public Works, a position he held until 1967. Wilson also participated in charitable organizations, acting as president of the Laborers' Annuity and Benefit Fund and chairman of the city employee's Community Fund Drive for many years. The Chicago Park District acquired the bath house from the city's Bureau of Parks and Recreation in 1959. By that time, indoor plumbing was widely available in the city, and the park district closed the underused bathing facilities the following year. The park district remodelled the building in the late 1960s, and the Wilson Community Center is now devoted entirely to recreational purposes. In 1991, Bridgeport residents asked that the community center's gymnasium be named for Joseph Bertucci, who had worked to transform the bath house into a recreational center serving children of all ages. Community members welcomed Bertucci's efforts to foster self esteem in local children. The park district honored this citizen request in 1992. "

Shortly thereafter, the commission graded and landscaped the former truck farm, installing a number of athletic fields. In 1929, the board built Amundsen High School on the northeast corner of the site. Chappell Elementary was built west of the high school in 1937. The site also includes Hansen field, a football and soccer stadium erected in the 1930s. The Chicago Park District took responsibility for maintaining the park facilities in 1959. In 1991, the Board of Education transferred to the park district the portion of the park lying south of Winnemac Street; the park district is now acquiring the remaining land. Winnemac Park is named for the adjacent street. The roadway in turn takes its name from Winamac, an important chief of the Potowatamie Indians. Winamac, whose name meant \"catfish,\" was a signer of the 1795 Treaty of Grenville, in which Great Lakes tribes surrendered the site of Chicago to the U.S. government. Winamac and his people fought with the British in the War of 1812, and the warrior died during the fighting. "

After filling and grading the site, the city installed a running track and playing field that could be flooded in winter for ice skating. The following year, a small frame fieldhouse and two small shelters were constructed; playground equipment installed; and trees, shrubs, and flowers planted. The city named the park for adjacent Wrightwood Avenue, which recognizes the four Chicago Wright brothers who developed the area in the mid 19th century. By 1910, more than 300,000 people used Wrightwood Park annually. In the fieldhouse, classes were offered to age groups ranging from kindergartners to adults. Activities included gymnastics, calisthenics, wrestling, dancing, games, raffia weaving, and sewing. The city organized baseball leagues played there in the summer. Boys from Wrightwood Park also participated in athletic meets at other city parks. In 1953, the park's original buildings were replaced by a modern fieldhouse.
